TikTok can appeal against the ruling within two months and 10 days of the decision.\n\nTikTok had insisted it was the "most capable challenger" to entrenched players in the digital sphere, but the court dismissed that argument.\n\n"TikTok had succeeded in increasing its number of users very rapidly and exponentially, reaching, in a short time, half the size of Facebook and of Instagram, and a particularly high engagement rate, with young users in particular, who spent more time on TikTok than on other social networks," the court said in a statement.\n\nThe judges acknowledged that in 2018, video sharing app TikTok was indeed a challenger but it had since then "rapidly consolidated its position and even strengthened that position over the following years" despite the launch of similar rival services.\n\n"We are disappointed with this decision. TikTok is a challenger platform that provides important competition to incumbent players," a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n"While we will now evaluate next steps, we already took measures to comply with the relevant obligations of the DMA ahead of last March\'s deadline."\n\nBut the court determined "ByteDance met the quantitative thresholds laid down in the DMA".\n\nFor Brussels to name a company as a gatekeeper, they must fulfil certain conditions.\n\nThe criteria include having more than 45 million monthly active users in the EU and more than 10,000 yearly active business users established in the bloc.\n\nDigital companies with an annual turnover in the EU of at least 7.5 billion euros ($8.2 billion) or a market value of above 75 billion euros also face the new curbs.\n\nIf a company violates the law, the EU can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company\'s total global turnover. This can rise to 20 percent for repeat offenders and in the most severe circumstances, the EU can order the break-up of companies.\n\nIt is the second defeat in the courts for TikTok over the DMA. It lost a bid in February to suspend the strict new rules pending the judgement handed down Wednesday.\n\nBig tech is not happy about the new law. Apple, contesting the DMA in the courts, has been vocal in its criticism, saying it puts users\' security at risk. -- Agence France-Presse', 'source': {'uri': 'bilyonaryo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Bilyonaryo Business News -'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bilyonaryo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tiktok-challenge.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.01960784313725483, 'wgt': 458931085, 'relevance': 54}

Also, a happy birthday shoutout to Terry Pendleton! And as always, Hochman picks a random St. Louis Cards card!\n\nVice president of scouting Dan Kantrovitz and the Chicago Cubs had a clear-cut plan entering the 2024 MLB draft.\n\nThey expected to be hitter-heavy on Days 1 and 2 for rounds 1-10, and then shift their focus to pitchers on Day 3 during rounds 11-20.\n\n"I think we obtained the right balance based on our assessment of the talent, the draft pool, as well fulfilling whatever needs we might have in the system," Kantrovitz said Tuesday at the conclusion of the three-day draft.\n\nKantrovitz doesn\'t expect any surprises, anticipating all 20 players the Cubs selected will sign. The Cubs ultimately chose nine pitchers (six right-handers and three left-handers), seven infielders, two outfielders and two catchers.\n\nHere are takeaways from the Cubs\' 2024 draft.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Flick Fact: Is there really a river under Normal? 1. They went college heavy\n\nBy the time the draft ended, only three of the Cubs\' 20 picks were high school players: shortstops Ronny Cruz (Miami Christian School in Florida) and Ty Southisene (Basic High School in Nevada) in the third and fourth rounds, respectively, and outfielder Eli Lovich (Blue Valley West High School in Kansas) in the 11th round.\n\nIt marked the second straight year the Cubs\' draft skewed toward college players, something Kantrovitz described as not the organization\'s philosophy, but a challenge that comes with taking prep players because of how much they tend to cost to sign.\n\n"In certain rounds, your options are limited," Kantrovitz said. "You try to be in position to draft and sign as many high school players as possible. You just at some point run out of room with the cap."\n\nEven with taking just three prep players, Kantrovitz expects the Cubs\' bonus pool allotment to skew toward them as much as any team. Lovich will require a "pretty substantial investment" to buy out his commitment to Arkansas and with that, like the player a lot. Kantrovitz credited area scout Ty Nichols for "raising the flag early" on Lovich, identifying him as one of the better bats he saw all spring in general, beyond just the high school demographic.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 left-handed hitting Lovich, rated the No. 1 outfielder and No. 3 overall recruit in Kansas by Perfect Game, posted a .402 average, .482 on-base percentage and 1.245 OPS with eight doubles, six triples, five home runs and 15 stolen bases his senior year.\n\nKantrovitz said Lovich put on a show in batting practice during a pre-draft workout at the Cubs complex in Mesa, Ariz., shagging fly balls and participating in high-performance testing.\n\n"We\'re pretty excited to watch his body just transform in the next couple of years and hopefully have that carryover to how hard he\'s hitting the ball and some power numbers too," he said. "But he\'s a pretty exciting one."\n\n2. Valuing performance against the best\n\nOne common theme among many of the Cubs\' selections is their participation and success playing in the Cape Cod League.\n\nIt\'s a group that includes Florida State third baseman Cam Smith (first round), College of Charleston third baseman Cole Mathis (second round), University of California-San Diego third baseman Matt Halbach (10th round), Grand Canyon right-hander Daniel Avitia (12th round), Lipscomb left-hander Hayden Frank (15th round), Georgia Southern right-hander Ben Johnson (17th round) and Indiana right-hander Brayden Risedorph (20th round).\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"The trick is to try to get as much bulk as you can from a performance standpoint, from a sort of a statistical standpoint, and then also be able to have context with that bulk," Kantrovitz said. "I think the way in which we can try to do that the most effectively is if it\'s against the best competition, and that tends to happen in the Cape League and also in the SEC and some of the other major conferences. When we can get players that have bulk in both, it gives us that much more confidence that those numbers are going to translate, and then our equivalencies end up translating to what we might expect them to do.\n\n"When they get into Low A and High A, many of the same players that they\'re competing against were those players that they were competing against in the Cape League or the SEC, so you just kind of have a better idea of where their floor is."\n\n3. Cubs land top defensive catchers\n\nSometimes future major-league caliber catchers can be difficult to find in the draft.\n\nWhen teams do identify some within the draft pool, it can be challenging to predict when they might go off the board, Kantrovitz said.\n\n"And if you\'re a team that takes them, that means you probably draft them a little bit earlier than teams would expect," he added.\n\nIt makes the pick of University of California-San Diego catcher Ariel Armas notable, particularly given his defensive pedigree. Between Armas\' defensive metrics and his accolades, his work behind the plate was considered one of the best in the country.\n\nArmas won the Gold Glove among Division I catchers last month after being named the 2024 West Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Year, and was one of 16 semifinalists for the 2024 Buster Posey National Collegiate Catcher of the Year Award. Armas, 21, owned a .998 fielding percentage while recording 15 caught stealing and led the country with 18.69 Defensive Runs Saved -- 3.58 more runs saved than the next closest player.\n\n"He\'s got a cannon of an arm and just looks really natural back there and he\'s got pretty exceptional framing skills," Kantrovitz said. "And because of this, when he put his framing, his caught stealing, his blocking, his receiving, when you put all those up against the other catchers both analytically and from a scouting standpoint, he stacks up pretty well."\n\n4. Plenty of slug can be found among the college bats\n\nThe Cubs are infusing more slug into their system.\n\nAmong the nine college position players they drafted, a couple certainly aren\'t lacking thump.\n\nSmith and Mathis -- their top two picks -- both feature the type of upside and power potential that\'s ideal in the first two rounds. Smith, 21, had a .654 slugging percentage and 39 extra-base hits as a draft-eligible sophomore at FSU, while Mathis, who turns 21 on July 25, recorded a .650 slugging percentage 33 XBH in his junior season at Charleston.\n\n"When you dig deeper, his chase rates, his in-zone contact rates, his exit velocities, his ability to really just hit the ball hard and in the air, keep the ball off the ground, which if you\'re looking at that from a performance standpoint that\'s indicated just by some of the ground ball-fly ball rates, and he seems to do it fairly effortlessly too," Kantrovitz said of Mathis.\n\n"He\'s a pretty strong kid and he\'s got a natural swing plane that lends itself to consistently hitting the ball in the air and then with his with his size and strength, he ends up putting pretty good charge into it."\n\nNicholls State first baseman Edgar Alvarez (eighth round) has put up dominant numbers, led by a .405/.514/.678 slash line. He hit 21 doubles and 13 home runs in 58 games, and has cut down his strikeout rate while improving his walk rate from his junior to senior season. Although he is on the older side -- he turns 24 in February -- Alvarez, who also won the D-1 Gold Glove this year at his position, was area scout Will Swoope\'s "gut-feel guy" as a player who has baseball card numbers that jump off the page, Kantrovitz said.\n\n"He has a beautiful, pure swing," Kantrovitz said. "As opposed to, like, just some gargantuan exit velos or gaudy numbers, which actually he has both at times. ... I think he could end up being a sleeper."\n\nUniversity of California-Santa Barbara outfielder Ivan Brethowr and his 6-foot-6, 250-pound frame produce strong exit velocity and power to tap into. Brethowr, 21, connected for 10 doubles and 15 home runs this year, part of a .275 average, .405 OBP and .968 OPS in 50 games.\n\n"When you have that base, it ends up being somebody that is also pretty exciting," Kantrovitz said. "He\'s a pretty well-balanced hitter in addition to having some some juice. It\'s good decision-making, it\'s good contact skills. It\'s generally square contact in the air."\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'pantagraph.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'pantagraph.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'armando_l_sanchez@pantagraph.com', 'name': 'Armando L.

You thought the greatest coach of all time was going to sit on the back porch, watch the Weather Channel and, for excitement, play pinochle for the rest of his life?\n\nFat chance.\n\nHalfway through SEC Media Days, the Southeastern Conference has paraded eight of its coaches and 24 players out for public view.\n\nBut the game is over. They can call off the final two days of blah-blah-blah, spare us more yada-yada-yada.\n\nDing-ding-ding -- we have a winner. Saban, from his perch in the back of the grand ball room of the Dallas Omni, is the unquestioned rock star of this latest preseason media days.\n\nAnd he\'s been a breath of fresh air for a week desperately seeking entertainment.\n\nSaban is part of -- if Saban can be just part of anything -- the SEC Network\'s coverage. It\'s a tune-up for his gig this fall on ESPN\'s popular Game Day show before each week\'s college games.\n\n"I\'m still a coach at heart," he kept saying. "I\'ve enjoyed it so far."\n\nYes, he\'s a bona fide, credentialed media member, joining that dispenser of "rat poison" that he so often railed against as Alabama\'s head coach.\n\nHe needs a little work on the "credentialed" angle.\n\nSEC commissioner Greg Sankey related that Saban was at first denied entry into the festivities.\n\nHe had to return to his hotel room to fetch the credential tag he\'d left behind.\n\n"I\'ve never worn a credential in my life and was always for 17 years able to get into SEC media day without a credential," Saban later explained on air. "I had to go back to the room today and get my credential to get in."\n\nIt was the only rookie mistake he made. Us commoners in the media can relate. Those security guards at big events take their jobs seriously, wait all year for a moment like that.\n\nOtherwise, on the first day of his full-time media gig, Saban was already the best thing to happen to sports television since Charles Barkley.\n\nHe already had the best line of the week, unsolicited, about the dominant story line of the week.\n\n"What tickles me," Saban said, "is all these questions about how Texas always ran the (Big 12) conference they were in. They\'re not going to run the SEC. There\'s a whole lot of arrogant people all over the SEC.\n\n"You can forget about that. They will be a good team and are a great program and (Texas head coach and former Saban assistant Steve Sarkisian) will do a great job, but it isn\'t going to be a problem."\n\nIt was good to get that cleared up. Pay attention. The man knows what he\'s talking about.\n\nHe pronounced his previous school, LSU, as one of his "sleeper" teams to win the SEC, in part because he\'s high on quarterback Garrett Nussmeier\'s talent (and patience) in replacing Heisman winner Jayden Daniels.\n\nHe\'s on board with Brian Kelly\'s process-oriented style, a philosophy he seemingly invented.\n\nYou thought maybe Saban was looking for a cushy job to tide him over and keep him out of Miss Terry\'s hair during "retirement?"\n\nRoss Dellenger of Google Sports shadowed Saban around the joint Monday and related that the ex-coach spent the last month talking to all 16 current SEC coaches. Also -- and this qualifies as self-imposed cruel and unusual punishment -- he watched tape of all 16 spring games.\n\nIt shouldn\'t be a surprise that he\'s good -- seemingly a natural -- at his new job. As a head coach, Saban could coach-speak with the best of them if the subject was Bama\'s upcoming game that week.\n\nBut get him on a topic of importance to the overall scheme of college football and you got an E.F. Hutton moment with all heads turned and all ears open.\n\nIf he\'s not the smartest guy in the room, he plays the part well.\n\nThe perfect job -- to match the genius with the pressing need -- would be as the commissioner-czar-whatever of college football.\n\nUntil then, you can look forward to College Game Day this fall.\n\nScooter Hobbs covers LSU athletics.

Read MoreMaya Hitigi/Getty Images\n\nCollier, Mandiant\'s chief threat intelligence adviser for Europe, spoke to Newsweek about the Olympics\' unique vulnerabilities.\n\n"The Olympics are a high-profile sporting event with a global audience, making them an ideal platform for cyberattacks aimed at psychological and reputational damage," Collier said, "as the impact of any disruption would be significantly amplified."\n\nThe paper outlines a range of cyber risks facing the Olympics, including cyber espionage, "destructive and disruptive" attacks and financially motivated hacking.\n\nBecause it\'s an international event attended by government officials and heads of state, Collier believes Russian hackers will try to use the event to "gather intelligence" on senior foreign decision makers.\n\nBut attendees should also be vigilant: such a large-scale event presents a perfect opportunity for cybercriminals of all kinds to target tourists with ticket fraud and try to steal their personal information.\n\nFor Collier, the worst-case scenario would be a massive, "destructive" attack, including the deployment of "wiper malware" to wipe data on targeted networks, that would disrupt the Paris Olympics.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks at the IOC Gala Dinner on the eve of the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, Thursday, Feb. 6, 2014. The Mandiant report names Russia as the highest-risk actor in these Olympics because of Russia\'s clear geopolitical motivations and history of disrupting past Olympic Games. More by Andrei Isakovych/Associated Press\n\nCollier argued that a number of factors conspire to make this year\'s Olympics particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee deemed Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine a "flagrant violation" of the Olympic Charter and immediately responded by banning Russia from competition in February 2022. Russian and Belarusian athletes will be able to continue competing under neutral flags.\n\nCollier said this gives Putin a "clear incentive" to target the Olympics, and combined with his sophisticated cyber espionage capabilities and track record of targeting the Olympics in the past, makes him the greatest risk to the Olympic Games.\n\nMandiant said Russian state-sponsored hackers leaked athlete data, disrupted networks during the opening ceremonies and conducted reconnaissance on Olympic officials during the 2016, 2018 and 2020 Olympics.\n\nCollier said France\'s fervent support for Ukraine in the wake of Russian aggression also makes the games an attractive target for geopolitically motivated attacks, making France the most likely target for a cyberattack.\n\nBut Collier said the response to the report since it was first released in June has been positive.\n\n"We\'re really encouraged that so many organizations with a stake in the Olympics are reading our report and taking action to address the threats that matter most to them," Collier said. "More organizations than ever before understand that identifying relevant threats can help them build a more proactive security posture."\n\nHave a story we should feature?

Emory & Henry made that move in recent years. Roanoke, restarting a football program, comes aboard in 2025. The ODAC football wing was in a transition phase.\n\nThe league addressed that this month by adding Gallaudet, forming an intriguing football-only affiliation. The university in Washington is dedicated to the advancement of deaf and hard of hearing individuals. The Bison will begin playing ODAC games in 2025.\n\n"About the time (Ferrum) made the decision to move to Division II and announce that, Gallaudet had reached out to ask about associate membership," said Brad Bankston, the ODAC commissioner since 1997. "It really was a convergence of multiple things happening all at once."\n\nPeople are also reading...

That had become increasingly challenging for the league whose membership includes Randolph-Macon, Hampden-Sydney, Washington and Lee, and other Virginia schools.\n\n"After a good bit of discussion, all of it positive, we determined (Gallaudet) was a good fit for us, for multiple reasons," Bankston said.\n\nGallaudet won the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference, which also includes Alfred State, Anna Maria, Dean and Vermont State, in 2013 and 2022. The Bison over the last five seasons went 4-5 (3-1 in the ECFC), 7-3 (5-1), 5-3 (3-3), 2-6 (2-3), and 3-5 (3-3).\n\nTheir roster has players from all over the country. Depth is commonly an issue because of the relatively small pool of prospects, and there are other challenges at a school for deaf and hard of hearing student-athletes.\n\nBenefits for Bison\n\nChuck Goldstein, who became Gallaudet\'s coach before the 2010 season, said, "I\'m not going to know what to do with myself when I get back home from an away game at like 8 p.m. That will be the first big difference because we\'ve been road dogs and we go up to (the Northeast frequently). To be able to go down the road a couple of hours and come back, I think that\'s going to be great for everybody involved.\n\n"Competitively, it\'s going to be a challenge, but it\'s a challenge we\'re looking forward to ... Obviously, the strength of schedule is going to increase. We\'re going to keep doing what we do. We\'ve been playing football for over 140 years. We\'re going to recruit. We\'re going to do the best we can. We\'re going to show up.\n\n"It\'s new and exciting."\n\nInventors of the huddle\n\nSpeaking of that Bison football tradition, Gallaudet is credited with creation of the huddle, in 1894. According to the school, Gallaudet quarterback Paul Hubbard was concerned that opposing teams were stealing Gallaudet\'s plays because his signing was in the open. He began circling up his teammates. The huddle was born.\n\nInnovation help\n\nGallaudet last season in one game used the AT&T 5G helmet, which allows a coach through a tablet to send a play to a quarterback helmet that includes a small screen mounted on the facemask.\n\nThe QB then relays the play to his teammates via signing in the huddle. This represented a significant improvement in the offense\'s communication system, according to Goldstein. The Bison could also change a play at the line, with the coach hitting an "alert" that flashed on the QB\'s screen, telling him to look to the sideline.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nQuarterbacks on the team will use that helmet throughout the 2024 season, thanks to an NCAA waiver.\n\n"It would be awesome to have all our players in (the AT&T 5G helmet)," said Goldstein.\n\nThat\'s not possible yet due to cost and current NCAA rules, according to the coach.\n\nStopping on the whistle\n\nAbout half of Gallaudet\'s players are completely deaf and communicate through American Sign Language, and the other half are hard of hearing, said Goldstein.\n\n"Some of those guys have hearing aids, medical implants. Some guys maybe have 30% hearing loss in one ear," he said. "It kind of varies. Some of our guys can hear whistles. Most can\'t."\n\nDefensively, there have been occasional issues with Gallaudet players failing to stop on the officials\' play-ending whistles, which cannot be heard by some of them. Penalties have resulted.\n\n"It does start with the officials. We have a pre-game meeting with officials," Goldstein said. "It\'s making sure they understand that it\'s not just standing there blowing the whistle and moving your hands to signal a play dead. They\'ve got to be active. They\'ve got to run in while they\'re blowing their whistles, so hopefully our players can get them in their peripheral.\n\n"It\'s also on our opponent to stop when the whistle blows."\n\n\'The standard\' applies at Randolph-Macon, splashing again in Division III postseason\n\nDrum vibrations\n\nOn the Gallaudet sideline, a large bass drum is part of the team\'s gear. In years past, vibrations from the drumbeat acted as the snap count, and started Bison plays. The team now uses hand signals for that purpose, but the drum still helps organize pregame drills, during games informs special-teamers when they should be preparing to go on the field, and serves other purposes.\n\nHow will ODAC teams change?\n\n"We have not delved into changes we may make on our campuses yet (for Gallaudet football visits). But I am aware of several things," said Bankston. "One, signing the National Anthem and providing that opportunity for their student-athletes to be able to experience that prior to the start of the game.\n\n"Operationally, from an officiating perspective, it\'s a little different as well. We haven\'t had a lot of conversations about that with our supervisor yet, but I have had conversations with Gallaudet\'s coach. Chuck\'s been very up front about explaining to me as we were having discussions about membership kind of what those perspectives need to be from the officiating side.\n\n"We\'ll have some conversations with our supervisor and our officials as a result of that after they\'ve had a chance to communicate prior to (the Bison) starting play in 2025.\n\n"I think there\'s a lot of this that we\'ll have an opportunity to kind of dissect a little bit with Gallaudet through the (upcoming) season.

The Tokyo Olympics had been postponed, training centres were shut, Covid-19 protocols were in place and the Olympic athletes she chatted with were having trouble sleeping and staying motivated. Their structured training routines were gone in a poof and the uncertainty was debilitating for many.\n\nAnother Olympics is upon us and this time, Divya, a sports psychologist, along with her senior colleague and psychiatrist, Dr Samir Parikh, are headed to Paris as part of the Indian Olympic Association\'s medical team. This sort of focus on mental health is not something Parikh, who has decades in the profession, would\'ve anticipated even five years ago.\n\n"The conventional idea of athletes needing mental support was largely to do with getting into a zone and reaching an optimal performance state," said Parikh, Chairperson, Fortis National Mental Health Program. "But now, we seem to understand that the mental wellness of an athlete is extremely important too. I wouldn\'t have imagined that there would come a day when two mental health professionals would be included in India\'s Olympic medical team. It\'s a huge step."\n\nIf the pandemic got the conversation started, the Tokyo Olympics intensified the global discourse on the importance of mental health. Simone Biles and the \'twisties\' were at the heart of it. The preternaturally talented Olympic champion gymnast pulled out of multiple events in Tokyo, citing that she had the \'twisties\' - a temporary loss of spatial awareness. According to data analytics company NewsWhip, Biles\' shocking withdrawal generated two million social media interactions and sparked a conversation on mental health, much higher than either Naomi Osaka\'s French Open withdrawal or Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\'s interview with Oprah. Google searches about mental health reportedly spiked on the day of Biles\' withdrawal, touching its highest in two months.\n\nAside from the stigma of seeking help with mental health issues, athletes face an additional hurdle. "There is a public perception of athletes being strong, unbreakable characters. Athletes can worry about being perceived as weak if they express emotions or mental struggle," says Divya, Head, Psychological Services for the Fortis National Mental Health Program. Virat Kohli once spoke of going through a phase in his career where he felt like "it was the end of the world". "In England 2014, I just didn\'t know what to do, what to say to anyone, how to speak, how to communicate. To be honest, I couldn\'t have said I am not feeling great mentally and I want to get away from the game, because you never know how that\'s taken."\n\nFor India\'s Paris-bound athletes, the mental health support by both experts won\'t just be limited to the duration of the Games. "We will be available to assist athletes both before as well as after the Games too," said Parikh. "The impact of the competition does, after all, tend to go on for longer. We\'ll of course be looking at both the performance enhancement aspect - how players are dealing with the pressures and expectations that come with the occasion - while also ensuring mental well-being and managing stress from extraneous factors."\n\nParikh and Divya, along with the rest of the IOA medical team, have been introduced to the Paris-bound athletes. "I travelled to SAI centers and NIS Patiala since it\'s important that athletes know us by name and face so they aren\'t sitting down with someone they\'ve never met before, in Paris. There\'s going to be a medical room where we\'ll be available and if the need arises we\'ll travel to the venues," said Divya.\n\n"At a stage like the Olympics, it\'s likely that many of the concerns could be performance or anxiety related. Whether it\'s a first-timer or someone returning from injury. We use visualisation both for mental rehearsal of technique and for athletes to plan for contingencies. Mindfulness-based training is helpful for regulating our emotions so that they don\'t derail us in high pressure moments. Also, bringing your focus back to the present, rather than fixating on the previous point, ensures you maintain an external locus when necessary and remain flexible. In high-pressure environments, athletes can have a tendency to try too hard, which is when things start to go wrong."\n\nUnlike their regular consultations, the window between an athlete seeking help and a workable solution is rather short in a live sporting event. Parikh sees it as an opportunity. "Rather than thinking we don\'t have time to fix this, we look at it as something where instead of days, the solution just needs to be applied for minutes or over a few games."\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) first came up with a mental health toolkit ahead of the Tokyo Games. This time, the body has provisioned for athletes to have access to a mindfulness app and a dedicated mental health helpline - operating 24/7 and covering 70 languages.\n\nFor perhaps the first time, mental health is getting the spotlight and preparedness it demands.', 'source': {'uri': 'hindustantimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Hindustan Times'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/17/1600x900/The-athletics-contingent--one-of-the-biggest-India_1721230038222.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 458927091, 'relevance': 51}

Here\'s what to know about the shopping event and some of the best Prime Day deals you can shop now.\n\nAmazon\'s Prime Day sale is officially back. It kicked off early yesterday morning and will run through Wednesday, July 17, though we\'ll be surprised if there\'s no lingering deals following the end of the event.\n\nPrime Day is Amazon\'s biggest sale event of the year, when you can save big across 35 product categories, from tech to home goods to clothes. Prime members can shop for new deals as often as every five minutes during select periods of the event and partake in exclusive invite-only deals. Plus, market competition with Prime Day has turned the month of July into a true shopping extravaganza that mimics holiday like sales in the heat of the summer, making it a great time to be a consumer (and a wallet).\n\nIn 2023, Prime members bought more than 375 million items and saved over $2.5 billion across the shopping site, the largest year on record for Amazon, according to the company. Since last July\'s Prime Day sale, the company has held a Prime Big Deal Days sale in October and, in March, promoted a Big Spring Sale for the first time. Read on for everything you need to know about this year\'s Prime Day sale, including some of the top deals you can snag right now.\n\nAlso: The best anti-Prime Day deals you can shop at Best Buy, Walmart, and beyond\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about Amazon is you\'ll find top deals on Amazon-exclusive products, tech, home, and everything in between. Here\'s a look at some top deals we\'ve found (including on everyday items) while scouring Amazon\'s Prime Day page for the best savings.\n\nPrime Day is always packed with deals across every category, especially flagship Amazon products like Echo devices, Fire TVs, Kindles, and more. Amazon says shoppers can anticipate deals across 35 categories, including home, tech, and more. During October Prime Day 2023, ZDNET readers scooped up savings on Fire Sticks, AirPods, chargers, and security cameras the most, but these Prime Day sales typically include many products.\n\nAlso: The 10 most popular October Prime Day deals among ZDNET readers\n\nAmazon shared in its release that Prime members can expect to jump on back-to-school savings and college essentials, find deep discounts across the site, and find deals on "new and popular" brands only available on Amazon for the upcoming event.\n\nSince the event kicked off, we\'re seeing similar prices as offered during the days leading up to the sale on Amazon products like Fire Sticks, Echo devices, Fire TVs, Kindles, and more. Some Apple products, like the Watch SE and Series 9 have dropped below pre-Prime Day offerings, and many lifestyle and home products, like Dyson vacuums, dropped in price overnight, too.\n\nPrime Day not only slashes prices on many top products on Amazon (across 35 categories, to be exact), but it also sparks generous competition among other major retailers such as Walmart, Target, Costco, Best Buy, and more. This means that you have a good chance of scoring a product you\'ve been eyeing for a discount of 30%, 40%, 50%, and even more at Amazon, or nabbing the very same or even better discount elsewhere.\n\nPlus, Prime Day is typically worth it for Amazon-exclusive products like Fire TVs, Fire tablets, Echo devices, Ring doorbells and cameras, Fire Sticks, and more (really, we\'re already seeing discounts of over 50% on these items). While sale periods can sometimes be tricky to know if you\'re getting the best deal, Prime Day generally does bring legitimate discounts, especially on tech. Remember, we\'re already seeing new smartphones, TVs, tablets, and more releases, which means more savings are incoming for older products.\n\nWe\'ve been keeping up with all the best Prime Day news since Amazon\'s confirmation of their 10th annual Prime Day back in April, and we\'ll continue to cover all the best deals you can shop during and after the popular event. Be sure to keep up with our Advice team on ZDNET.com throughout the sale. We\'ll be updating the site with all the details you need to shop savvy -- including the best deals on products we\'ve personally tested and would recommend.\n\nAmazon\'s biggest sales event of the year, Prime Day 2024 starts today, with major discounts across various product categories, including phones, laptops, TVs, audio, and more. While the best deals are available for Prime members only, sellers often mark down products for non-Prime members to take advantage of. The event officially takes place on July 16 and July 17. Plus, Amazon always has shoppable deals available you can explore.\n\nPrime Day is Amazon\'s most popular flagship seasonal savings event, typically in mid-July each year. Although Amazon has since branched out to add an October Prime event and other sales, this July Prime Day remains the holy grail of Amazon sales.\n\nPrime Day grants Amazon Prime members exclusive access to deals on Amazon.com across all categories, including home, tech, apparel, and more.\n\nAmazon\'s Prime Day is an exclusive sale for Amazon Prime members.

Prime Day began in July 2015, on the company\'s 20th birthday. However, the retail giant has recently expanded its sale periods to become more frequent. For the past two years, Amazon added a sale called Prime Big Deal Days in October, colloquially dubbed "October Prime Day." We expect the same for this year.\n\nFrom March 20-25, 2024, Amazon launched its first-ever Big Spring Sale, a sale event expected to appear again next year.\n\nIn 2020, Amazon ran its Prime Day sale event in October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in October 2022, the retail giant offered a "Prime Day Early Access" sale event, and most recently, in October 2022, Amazon ran an "October Prime Day" for the first time. Since we also saw an October Prime Day in 2023, we anticipate another Prime-related sale event will pop up in October 2024.\n\nThroughout the sale, we\'ll be extensively updating ZDNET.com live with all the best deals on products we\'ve tested and would recommend. We\'ll also curate, share, and update hand-picked lists of top deals in several product categories, including laptops, security cameras, tablets, Amazon devices, and more.\n\nAmazon also offers "Lightning Deals" during its sale events, which are time- and inventory-sensitive. Look for this tag on any products you want to purchase -- if you see it, you may want to check it out -- and fast. Throughout select periods during Prime Day, new deals will continue to drop as often as every 5 minutes. Plus, invite-only deals are back. Prime members can also request an invitation to access invite-only deals -- exclusive Prime Day deals Amazon is anticipating to sell out.\n\nYes, Prime Day has officially kicked off, and you can shop the site. We\'ll be extensively covering the best deals throughout the sale, including operating a live blog all day on the hottest Prime Day grabs.\n\nAlso: The best Prime Day deals: Live updates\n\nPrime Day brings discounts across nearly 35 categories (some of the best being in tech). There are not necessarily specific items to avoid, but remember to keep your eyes out for discounts and listing prices. Sometimes, during big savings events, it\'s hard to tell what\'s really a "discount." If you\'re checking in with all of ZDNET\'s Prime Day content, don\'t worry -- we\'ll be expert-vetting deals to ensure they\'re worth your money. If you\'re shopping on your own, make sure to do some research on historical pricing using tools like Google Shopping and more.\n\nAlso: Google expands its shopping tools just in time for Amazon Prime Day. Here\'s how to use them\n\nYes, as we\'ve seen in the past, other major retailers will undoubtedly offer competing sales, deals, and discounts. Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and other retailers try to compete with Amazon\'s Prime Day offerings, often price-cutting the same items during the same periods or extending their own sales. We\'ll cover all the best deals on top tech during Amazon\'s Prime Day event, including deals surfacing elsewhere.\n\nThe answer here is hard to say. It\'s a yes, but also a no. Invite-only Prime deals -- or Lightning deals -- may be different each day. Amazon confirmed last month that new deals may surface as often as every five minutes on the site. But, as always, deals only last as long as Amazon decides, with lighting deals offering a countdown to their expiration, and other deals\' longevity depending on how fast products sell out (or don\'t). It\'s likely that as long as stock remains, many of the deals from Day 1 will remain live for Day 2, including deals on popular Amazon products such as Fire TVs, Kindles, Fire tablets, Echo devices, and more.', 'source': {'uri': 'zdnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ZDNet'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/b8a79cb95f4083d72c569b9b2f79b11f60008559/2024/07/01/3ea08462-c66d-4355-961f-3ff912eba13d/prime-day-2024-6.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200', 'eventUri': 'eng-9735322', 'sentiment': 0.3647058823529412, 'wgt': 458926568, 'relevance': 26}

Where will the money go?', 'body': 'Julia Poe, Chicago Tribune\n\nThe price of being a Chicago Sky fan just went up.\n\nIt was inevitable. Even a casual viewer this season could see it coming: the sold-out crowds, the back-ordered jerseys, the record-breaking viewership. The popularity of Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardoso -- and the 2024 draft class at large -- has been undeniable, commanding a wave of demand for tickets and merchandise that was certain to be balanced out by a surge in pricing.\n\nBut for many longtime season ticket holders, the change came as a shock this week when the Sky sent out emails detailing next year\'s invoices would be doubled -- or more -- from their original prices. Courtside seats for the 2025 season skyrocketed from $4,500 to $11,000. More affordable 18-game packages for 200-level seats jumped from $270 to $985.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Flick Fact: Is there really a river under Normal?\n\nThis sticker shock reflects the intricacies of the transitional period the Sky are currently wading through as they attempt to retain their long-time fanbase while expanding to establish a larger footprint in Chicago. As the front office declines requests to speak about a months-old promise to announce plans for a new training facility, a natural question follows: where exactly will all that money go?\n\nIn the early years of the WNBA, affordability was a driving force in attracting and maintaining fans. In 2021, the average Sky ticket price was $43. Even after the championship win at the end of that season, ticket prices remained relatively stable in ensuing seasons, jumping to an average price of $88 this year. This made the team uniquely accessible to fans in an otherwise expensive sports market.\n\nBut this week\'s jump in pricing seems to reflect that the Sky are adjusting to market norms in Chicago. For instance, it cost an average of $276 to attend a Bulls game last season as the team led the league in attendance despite relatively apathetic results on the court.\n\nIt feels superfluous to pose the question of what exactly changed to garner this sudden spike. What changed? Everything. The WNBA is riding an unprecedented surge of attention and popularity. As a result, teams and the league are attempting to recalibrate their worth - in ticket prices, media rights deals and even in the valuation of the franchises - almost overnight.\n\nAt its core, this is a reflection of success. Women\'s basketball has never been a hotter ticket. And players are already seeing the pay-off as they earn major wins like charter flights that the players union had been fighting to achieve for years.\n\nFor the Sky, the real issue is what comes next. Fans are clamoring for standard improvements to match those beefed-up ticket prices -- including better food and drink options at Wintrust Arena, better perks for season ticket holders and improved in-game entertainment. But for the Sky, investment and revenue is an issue that runs much deeper.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe Sky are still struggling to shake a long-held reputation of being a "cheap" franchise, which is centered around the team training in a public recreation center in Deerfield.\n\nIn an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times earlier this year, Lincolnwood native Jewell Loyd said she passed over the Sky in free agency due to a lack of investment, adding that players across the WNBA are "waiting for Chicago to step up" before the franchise can become a legitimate contender for free agents.\n\nWith the promise created by Cardoso and Reese - along with additions like coach Teresa Weatherspoon and crafty guard Chennedy Carter - the Sky have never been better positioned to redefine themselves. But they can\'t take that step until they move their players into a more professional training facility -- a process that increased revenue could certainly assist.\n\nSky operating chairman Nadia Rawlinson has declined to speak with the Tribune about these efforts and refused questions until the front office is prepared to make a public announcement about the facility. But that announcement should have already been made in May, when Rawlinson promised the Sky would have a significant update on the training facility before the start of the season.\n\nRelated ArticlesChicago Sky | Chennedy Carter scores 34 and Angel Reese records another double-double as Chicago Sky beat Las Vegas AcesChicago Sky | Angel Reese\'s double-double streak comes to an end as the Chicago Sky fall to the New York Liberty 81-67Chicago Sky | Chicago Sky are the worst 3-point shooting team in the WNBA.

The Chicago Sky guard believes it: \'Just keep watching.\'\n\nTwo months and 24 games later, the Sky have not provided a timeline or any further updates, other than the fact that their current lease at Sachs Recreation Center runs out at the end of the year. This might seem like a worn out issue, but only because the franchise has been stuck in the same public position for more than a year, continuously stalling with cheery promises that have not been fulfilled.\n\nInertness is a status quo the Sky can no longer afford. Sure, ticket sales are up this year, but this is an inherited value. The Sky did not make Cardoso or Reese a star. And while drafting one of the most popular women\'s athletes in the country - maybe the world - has brought a boom of success for the team this season, that\'s not a sustainable business model to replicate in the future.\n\nRookie contracts are short. Whether they realize it or not, the Sky are already making their free-agency pitches -- both to their rookies and to the potential free agents who could join them to chase down another title. And despite an understanding throughout the franchise of their image around the league, the Sky have yet to "step up" to the challenge set by players like Loyd.\n\nRising ticket prices might be the cost of doing business as the WNBA continues to rise in popularity. But the increase of investment from Sky ownership will have to match it -- or the team risks being left behind once again.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'pantagraph.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'pantagraph.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'julia_poe@pantagraph.com', 'name': 'Julia Poe', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pantagraph.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/92/d92bde03-5f1f-5304-a3e4-453aed8880f4/6697e20074a23.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.003921568627450966, 'wgt': 458926445, 'relevance': 51}

The Cubs ultimately chose nine pitchers (six right-handers and three left-handers), seven infielders, two outfielders and two catchers.\n\nHere are four takeaways from the Cubs\' 2024 draft.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Flick Fact: Is there really a river under Normal? 1. They went college heavy with their picks.\n\nBy the time the draft ended, only three of the Cubs\' 20 picks were high school players: shortstops Ronny Cruz (Miami Christian School in Florida) and Ty Southisene (Basic High School in Nevada) in the third and fourth rounds, respectively, and outfielder Eli Lovich (Blue Valley West High School in Kansas) in the 11th round.\n\nIt marked the second straight year the Cubs\' draft skewed toward college players, something Kantrovitz described as not the organization\'s philosophy, but a challenge that comes with taking prep players because of how much they tend to cost to sign.\n\n"In certain rounds, your options are limited," Kantrovitz said. "You try to be in position to draft and sign as many high school players as possible. You just at some point run out of room with the cap."\n\nEven with taking just three prep players, Kantrovitz expects the Cubs\' bonus pool allotment to skew toward them as much as any team. Lovich will require a "pretty substantial investment" to buy out his commitment to Arkansas and with that, like the player a lot. Kantrovitz credited area scout Ty Nichols for "raising the flag early" on Lovich, identifying him as one of the better bats he saw all spring in general, beyond just the high school demographic.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 left-handed hitting Lovich, rated the No. 1 outfielder and No. 3 overall recruit in Kansas by Perfect Game, posted a .402 average, .482 on-base percentage and 1.245 OPS with eight doubles, six triples, five home runs and 15 stolen bases his senior year.\n\nKantrovitz said Lovich put on a show in batting practice during a pre-draft workout at the Cubs complex in Mesa, Ariz., shagging fly balls and participating in high-performance testing.\n\n"We\'re pretty excited to watch his body just transform in the next couple of years and hopefully have that carryover to how hard he\'s hitting the ball and some power numbers too," he said. "But he\'s a pretty exciting one."\n\n2. Valuing performance against the best competition.\n\nOne common theme among many of the Cubs\' selections is their participation and success playing in the Cape Cod League.\n\nIt\'s a group that includes Florida State third baseman Cam Smith (first round), College of Charleston third baseman Cole Mathis (second round), University of California-San Diego third baseman Matt Halbach (10th round), Grand Canyon right-hander Daniel Avitia (12th round), Lipscomb left-hander Hayden Frank (15th round), Georgia Southern right-hander Ben Johnson (17th round) and Indiana right-hander Brayden Risedorph (20th round).\n\n"The trick is to try to get as much bulk as you can from a performance standpoint, from a sort of a statistical standpoint, and then also be able to have context with that bulk," Kantrovitz said. "I think the way in which we can try to do that the most effectively is if it\'s against the best competition, and that tends to happen in the Cape League and also in the SEC and some of the other major conferences. When we can get players that have bulk in both, it gives us that much more confidence that those numbers are going to translate, and then our equivalencies end up translating to what we might expect them to do.\n\n"When they get into Low A and High A, many of the same players that they\'re competing against were those players that they were competing against in the Cape League or the SEC, so you just kind of have a better idea of where their floor is."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n3. Cubs land one of the best defensive catchers in the country.\n\nSometimes future major-league caliber catchers can be difficult to find in the draft.\n\nWhen teams do identify some within the draft pool, it can be challenging to predict when they might go off the board, Kantrovitz said.\n\n"And if you\'re a team that takes them, that means you probably draft them a little bit earlier than teams would expect," he added.\n\n2024 MLB draft: A look at players with Illinois connections who were selected -- and by which teams\n\nIt makes the pick of University of California-San Diego catcher Ariel Armas notable, particularly given his defensive pedigree. Between Armas\' defensive metrics and his accolades, his work behind the plate was considered one of the best in the country.\n\nArmas won the Gold Glove among Division I catchers last month after being named the 2024 West Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Year, and was one of 16 semifinalists for the 2024 Buster Posey National Collegiate Catcher of the Year Award. Armas, 21, owned a .998 fielding percentage while recording 15 caught stealing and led the country with 18.69 Defensive Runs Saved -- 3.58 more runs saved than the next closest player.\n\n"He\'s got a cannon of an arm and just looks really natural back there and he\'s got pretty exceptional framing skills," Kantrovitz said. "And because of this, when he put his framing, his caught stealing, his blocking, his receiving, when you put all those up against the other catchers both analytically and from a scouting standpoint, he stacks up pretty well."\n\n4. Plenty of slug can be found among the college bats.\n\nThe Cubs are infusing more slug into their system.\n\nAmong the nine college position players they drafted, a couple certainly aren\'t lacking thump.\n\nSmith and Mathis -- their top two picks -- both feature the type of upside and power potential that\'s ideal in the first two rounds. Smith, 21, had a .654 slugging percentage and 39 extra-base hits as a draft-eligible sophomore at FSU, while Mathis, who turns 21 on July 25, recorded a .650 slugging percentage 33 XBH in his junior season at Charleston.\n\nRelated ArticlesChicago Cubs | Red Sox\'s Jarren Duran\'s 2-run HR gives the American League a 5-3 win over the National League in the MLB All-Star GameChicago Cubs | Cubs\' Shota Imanaga picks a perfect jingle for All-Star Game, while White Sox\'s Garrett Crochet \'absorbs\' his big momentChicago Cubs | Column: Velocity is the name in the MLB All-Star Game -- and perhaps every game in the futureChicago Cubs | 2024 MLB draft: A look at players with Illinois connections who were selected -- and by which teamsChicago Cubs | MLB players in 2028 Olympics?

Commissioner Rob Manfred says both are possible.\n\n"When you dig deeper, his chase rates, his in-zone contact rates, his exit velocities, his ability to really just hit the ball hard and in the air, keep the ball off the ground, which if you\'re looking at that from a performance standpoint that\'s indicated just by some of the ground ball-fly ball rates, and he seems to do it fairly effortlessly too," Kantrovitz said of Mathis.\n\n"He\'s a pretty strong kid and he\'s got a natural swing plane that lends itself to consistently hitting the ball in the air and then with his with his size and strength, he ends up putting pretty good charge into it."\n\nNicholls State first baseman Edgar Alvarez (eighth round) has put up dominant numbers, led by a .405/.514/.678 slash line. He hit 21 doubles and 13 home runs in 58 games, and has cut down his strikeout rate while improving his walk rate from his junior to senior season. Although he is on the older side -- he turns 24 in February -- Alvarez, who also won the D-1 Gold Glove this year at his position, was area scout Will Swoope\'s "gut-feel guy" as a player who has baseball card numbers that jump off the page, Kantrovitz said.\n\n"He has a beautiful, pure swing," Kantrovitz said. "As opposed to, like, just some gargantuan exit velos or gaudy numbers, which actually he has both at times. ... I think he could end up being a sleeper."\n\nUniversity of California-Santa Barbara outfielder Ivan Brethowr and his 6-foot-6, 250-pound frame produce strong exit velocity and power to tap into. Brethowr, 21, connected for 10 doubles and 15 home runs this year, part of a .275 average, .405 OBP and .968 OPS in 50 games.\n\n"When you have that base, it ends up being somebody that is also pretty exciting," Kantrovitz said. "He\'s a pretty well-balanced hitter in addition to having some some juice. It\'s good decision-making, it\'s good contact skills. It\'s generally square contact in the air."\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'pantagraph.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'pantagraph.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'meghan_montemurro@pantagraph.com', 'name': 'Meghan Montemurro', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pantagraph.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b32c1a3a-f6a7-11e5-b75e-6b57a5d92d3d.png?resize=600%2C315', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 458925754, 'relevance': 51}

Bumble is the league\'s first-ever official dating app partner, creating inclusive spaces for women to forge meaningful connections over a shared love of the game.\n\nThe partnership tips off during AT&T WNBA All-Star 2024, taking place in Phoenix, AZ from July 18-July 20. Bumble will serve as the presenting partner of the iconic Orange Carpet at WNBA Live presented by U.S. Bank. The collaboration will also include behind-the-scenes and Bumble in-app content from WNBA athletes, exciting activations at fan events like WNBA Live, WNBA-themed Bumble meetups, and unforgettable experiences for Bumble members, including date nights at some of the WNBA\'s biggest games and moments. Additionally, people on Bumble with the "basketball" interest badge will receive local market game day reminders, exclusive content, and updates on experiences.\n\n"Partnering with one of the most renowned organizations in women\'s sports, the WNBA, is extremely exciting for us and it exemplifies everything Bumble stands for: empowering and spotlighting women\'s stories, helping people make connections over shared values and interests, and creating fun and safe experiences to bring our community together offline," said Lidiane Jones, CEO at Bumble. "We know being a sports fan is an important part of who people are and we look forward to celebrating that through this partnership."\n\n"Bumble\'s history of encouraging and championing women resonates deeply with the core values of the WNBA," said WNBA Chief Growth Officer Colie Edison. "Our partnership with Bumble furthers our shared mission of empowering women, and we look forward to creating impactful, inspiring opportunities focused on the power of connection."\n\nOver the years, Bumble has been committed to advancing women\'s equity and empowerment in sports. In 2023, Bumble launched its 50for50 campaign by teaming up with 50 college athletes through Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for the 50th anniversary of Title IX. This year, Bumble expanded upon those deals by inking sponsorships with four-time All-American and WBCA Defensive Player of the Year Cameron Brink and two-time U.S. Junior National gold medalist Jada Williams.\n\n"To collaborate alongside a company who centers around women was super important to me. From starting my time with Bumble as a college athlete to now growing with them in the WNBA makes our relationship that much more special," said Cameron Brink, WNBA athlete and Bumble Ambassador. "The first moves Bumble has made in sports over the years are so inspiring and I can\'t wait to see the impact their partnership with the WNBA will have on fans everywhere."\n\nAdditionally, in 2019 Bumble created the first all-women Esports team, breaking new ground in a traditionally male-dominated field, and in 2018, launched the Empowerment Badge as a symbol of dedication to women\'s empowerment in sports.\n\nAbout Bumble\n\nBumble, the women-first dating and social networking app, was founded by Whitney Wolfe Herd in 2014. Bumble connects people across dating (Bumble Date), friendship (Bumble For Friends) and professional networking (Bumble Bizz). Bumble is built on the importance of equitable relationships and how crucial they are to a healthy, happy life. The app is built with a focus on kindness, respect, and equality - and the community plays an important part in that.\n\nBumble holds its users accountable for their actions and strives to provide them with an experience free from hate, aggression, or bullying. The app is free to download and is widely available in the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and the web.\n\nAbout the WNBA\n\nThe WNBA is a bold, progressive basketball league that stands for the power of women. Featuring 12 teams and in its 28th season in 2024, the W is a unique sports property that combines competition and entertainment with a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and social responsibility. Through its world-class athletes, the in-game fan experience, TV and digital broadcasts, digital and social content, and community and youth outreach programs, the league celebrates and elevates the game of basketball and the culture around it. In 2020, the WNBA and the Women\'s National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) signed a groundbreaking CBA that has charted a new course for women\'s basketball - and women\'s sports overall - with a focus on increased player compensation, improvements to the player experience, expanded career development opportunities and resources specifically tailored to the female professional athlete. Key elements of the agreement are supported through the league\'s partnership platform, the WNBA Changemakers Collective, with AT&T, the WNBA\'s Marquee Partner and inaugural Changemaker, as well as fellow inaugural Changemakers Deloitte and NIKE, Inc., and subsequent additions Google, U.S. Bank and CarMax. During the 2020 season, the WNBA and WNBPA launched the WNBA Justice Movement forming the Social Justice Council with the mission of being a driving force of necessary change and continuing work regarding women\'s and maternal health and voting rights, among other important societal issues.', 'source': {'uri': 'pr.nba.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBA.com: NBA Communications'}, 'authors': [], 'image': None, 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.5058823529411764, 'wgt': 458924806, 'relevance': 26}

Ask me anything!\n\nMen earn an average of 36% more than women in search marketing in 2024, according to a new Search Engine Land survey.\n\nWhile there is less of a gender pay gap disparity in senior positions, there is still a disparity.\n\nAdditionally, women were more likely to have changed jobs or received promotions more recently than men. And men and women are similarly satisfied with their current role, the survey revealed.\n\nWhy we care. People should receive equal compensation for equal work, regardless of gender. However, Search Engine Land\'s 2024 Salary and Career Survey indicates that isn\'t happening. The gap between salaries for men and women in search marketing hasn\'t closed. Rather, pay inequality has widened.\n\nMen earn 36% more than women. Men earned an average of $130,000 in 2024 (vs. $105,250 in 2023) while women earned an average of $95,000 in 2024 (vs. $83,265 in 2023).\n\nThat means men earn $34,500 (or 36%) more, on average, than women in search marketing, according to our survey. Men earned 26% more than women in 2023.\n\nFor context, in the U.S., full-time working women are paid roughly 82% to 84% of what men earn. That means the disparity we see here is more than double the U.S. average.\n\nMen in senior positions earn 8% more than women. The search marketing pay gap is less pronounced in senior positions.\n\nFor director-level and higher positions (i.e., director, senior director, VP, SVP, C-suite), there is an 8% pay difference - $175,479 for men compared to $161,943 for women in 2024. For manager and staff positions, there is a 26% pay difference ($107,026 for men, $85,114 for women).\n\nJob changes and promotions. 38% of women were promoted or changed jobs in the past 12 months, compared to 25% of men.\n\n15% of women and men reported changing jobs or getting a promotion in the past six months. Another 23% of women changed jobs or were promoted within the past year, compared to 10% of men.\n\nJob satisfaction. Women are slightly more satisfied with their current roles. A majority of men and women reported being either extremely or somewhat satisfied with their roles:\n\nExtremely satisfied: 20% of men; 18% of women. Somewhat satisfied: 45% of men; 50% of women.\n\nHowever, compared to last year, both men and women are less satisfied with their roles. In 2023, 24% of men and 27% of women said they were extremely satisfied, while 56% of men and 45% of women were somewhat satisfied.\n\nMen and women were equally neutral about their roles - 14% - while 22% of men said they were somewhat or not satisfied with their roles, compared to 18% of women:\n\nMen: 10% not satisfied; 12% somewhat unsatisfied. Women: 5% not satisfied; 13% somewhat unsatisfied.\n\nMethodology. Our survey results are based on responses from 291 individuals in North America (79%) and Western Europe (21%). Due to the limited number of respondents, other regions were excluded. We used the "median" results for salaries to filter out values that might skew the results.\n\nThe 2024 Search Engine Land Salary and Career Survey was conducted between December and February. Invitations to take the survey were amplified on and by Search Engine Land. The survey included more than 20 questions related to career roles, salary, technology, job satisfaction and challenges/frustrations. Respondents were also asked to reveal their age and gender.\n\nAdd Search Engine Land to your Google News feed.\n\nRelated stories\n\nNew on Search Engine Land\n\nGoogle tightens AdMob policies, reshaping ad placement rules\n\n5 ways to incorporate trends into your SEO content strategy\n\nThe Kanban approach to efficient PPC campaign management\n\nHow to address the top reputation issues impacting brands today\n\nThe Rise of Personalization in E-commerce: 2024 Consumer Insights\n\nAbout the author\n\nStaff\n\nDanny Goodwin\n\nDanny Goodwin has been Managing Editor of Search Engine Land &\n\nSearch Marketing Expo - SMX since 2022.

So far, the district has three agreements and has made 40 offers based on appraisals, with the coming months promising a flurry of activity.\n\n"It\'s quite a process," said Richard Thomasser, the district manager.\n\nThe flood control district is poised to use eminent domain powers to acquire land when negotiations with owners fail, allowing the Napa County Superior Court to settle the price.\n\nThis next phase of the flood control project involves building a flood wall on the west side of the Napa River for about a mile, from near the Elks Lodge south of Trancas Street past Lincoln Avenue to the Oxbow area. The goal is to protect hundreds of properties from the peak flood level expected every 100 years.\n\nPeople are also reading... $400K in unpaid bills for grapes lead to slew of lawsuits against Napa winemaker Ryan Seacrest\'s Napa County home up for sale at $22 million Customers are raving about Moulin -- downtown Napa\'s new café and bakery Hank McGraw, onetime baseball phenom turned maverick and late-life Napan, dead at 81 Letter: Concerns about St. Helena Agritourism Initiative Mount Veeder vineyard owners sue own lawyers over money tied to Tubbs Fire Napa City Council to weigh selling land for downtown development Napa High School Athletic Hall of Fame: Cabral learned from sports how to battle adversity in life Why is that?

The board approved buying 1.42 acres of vacant industrial land along the Napa River at 501 North Bay Drive near Lincoln Avenue for $675,000.\n\nThe board was also scheduled to initiate eminent domain for vacant property at 1114 Jordan Lane south of Lincoln Avenue. The district and owners have been unable to agree on a price for a 15-foot-wide strip of land along the river and temporary construction easements.\n\nBut the board needs a two-thirds vote to initiate eminent domain. Not enough members attended the meeting to meet that threshold.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"To be continued," said board chair and Napa Mayor Scott Sedgley.\n\nDistrict engineer Andrew Butler told the board that 95% of the design for the project should be completed in the fall. Sedgley called this "really good news."\n\nThis latest phase of the flood control project is to protect an area near Lincoln Avenue and along Soscol Avenue that last flooded during the 2005-06 New Year\'s Eve storms. Muddy Napa River water spilled onto streets and into homes and businesses.\n\nFlood control has long been a concern locally, with the Napa Valley experiencing about two dozen major floods since pioneer days. But the community balked when the federal government in the 1960s proposed lining a section of the Napa River with concrete as a solution.\n\nBig storms in February 1986 once again put flood control in the spotlight. Flooding caused an estimated $140 million in damage, destroyed 250 homes and prompted 7,000 evacuations in Napa Valley.\n\nNapa County communities and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers launched the Napa River flood control project in 1998. Voters passed a now-expired half-cent sales tax to help fund the undertaking, with the federal and state governments also providing money.\n\nFlood control Napa-style would not involve a concrete-lined river. Instead, the emphasis would be on a "living river" concept depending largely on floodplains and flood walls.\n\nSince then, the city of Napa has seen such work down as major bridges replaced and floodplains created. The last major project was the $18.5 million flood control bypass between the Oxbow area and downtown, completed in 2015 and named the Oxbow Commons.\n\nBut work remained. In 2021, Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, announced the Army Corps of Engineers would provide $48.3 million for remaining portions of the flood control project. Local funds, grants and developer contributions were to boost the total to about $94 million.\n\nThe Lincoln Avenue-area project is coming first. Next, the flood control district plans to construct a flood wall and trail along the western river from Imola Avenue to near the Napa County Library, much of it along Riverside Drive. Work is also to be done in the Oxbow area.\n\nThrowback Thursday: A look at the Napa River St. Helena on the Napa River Schooner on the Napa River Napa River Scene Napa River 1920 Flood of 1940 at Pearl Street Napa River Sailboats on the Napa River Service boat in Napa River Uncle Sam Wine Cellars from the Napa River Zinfandel Steamer in the Napa River Gondola on the Napa River\n\nYou can reach Barry Eberling at 707-256-2253 or beberling@napanews.com\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Now, They'll Compete in Paris for the Refugee Olympic Team", 'body': 'They compete under the same flag but speak different languages and come from different parts of the world. After fleeing war and persecution at home, 37 athletes from 11 countries will compete in the Paris Games as part of the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nThe team was created for the Rio Olympics in 2016 as a symbol of hope and to call attention to the plight of refugees worldwide.\n\nIn Paris, the refugee athletes will take the stage at a time of record global migration, with hundreds of millions of people -- many of them displaced from their homes -- working to reinvent themselves just as these athletes have.\n\nThe record migration comes alongside a rise in far-right populism across much of the world, with officials and parties in many countries promising to clamp down on immigration and asylum.\n\nAt the Games, athletes will compete in a host country where the anti-immigration far-right party saw a surge of voter support in parliamentary elections, but was beaten back by a coalition of the French left and failed to win a majority.\n\nThe refugee athletes will compete in 12 sports, but for many, their journey to Paris is already a victory in itself.\n\nFernando Dayán Jorge, Cuban, canoeing\n\nFernando Dayán Jorge spent his childhood flying past rickety fishing boats and colonial houses in the bay next to his home in Cienfuegos, Cuba.\n\nSince he began practicing there with his father when he was 11, he said it feels as if he\'s lived a thousand lifetimes.\n\nThe 25-year-old canoeist was a two-time Olympian for Cuba\'s national team in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Then, a gold medalist. A deserter of the Cuban team. A migrant. A maintenance worker. And a refugee.\n\nNow, he continues to rocket along on his narrow red-and-white canoe, this time flying past suburban homes in the canals winding through Cape Coral, Florida.\n\nKneeling on his boat, his oar slices through the air as his coach chants "very good work, very good work" from a boat next to him.\n\nJorge\'s eyes are fixed ahead, throwing all his force into his third Olympics.\n\n"After having written off the 2024 Paris Olympics, it\'s a massive opportunity," he said. "There are so many Cubans that come to this country and lose this dream of competing once again, simply because they don\'t know how to get back to this place."\n\nJorge was at the top of his career, having won gold in Tokyo for the 1,000-meter canoe sprint, when he took a daunting step in March 2021. While training in Mexico, Jorge defected, joining a growing number of Cuban athletes in deserting their country amid an ongoing migratory flight.\n\nSome hope to make more money than they can in the communist-run island. Others, like Jorge, say they left because of political differences over how the government treats citizens and athletes.\n\nHe left behind his home and crossed into the United States via the Rio Grande, in hopes of a better -- if uncertain -- life.\n\nArriving to Florida was, in some ways, like starting from scratch. Granted refugee status in the U.S., Jorge said he would wake up hours before sunrise to train, then work eight hours in a maintenance gig to pay his bills.\n\nHe said he watched friends forced to give up everything after migrating, but he fought to continue as a professional athlete.\n\n"I had a hard time getting out of bed every day and keeping my head on straight," he said. "I had no support whatsoever."\n\nBecoming one of the first Cubans to compete on the Refugee Olympic Team changed everything for him, he said. Still, he is among those who\'ve struggled to cover the costs of competing internationally. He opened a GoFundMe page in June to help pay his way to the Games.\n\nCuba has protested the inclusion of Jorge and Cuban weightlifter Ramiro Mora on the team, saying they should not be considered refugees.\n\nToday, Jorge\'s life in Cuba and his future in Florida seem to blend together in his home. His red, blue and white Cuba jersey sits framed over his doorway, while medals from competitions in the U.S. hang over a statue of the Olympic emblem.\n\n"To the refugees and athletes who\'ve been through the same thing, I want to tell them to not give up," he said. "No matter how dark the days become, the sun is always going to rise."\n\nManizha Talash, Afghan, breaking\n\nManizha Talash does not fear the Taliban.\n\n"I\'m here because I want to reach my dream. Not because I\'m scared," she declared from Spain, where she was granted asylum.\n\nOn the outskirts of Madrid, the 21-year-old is training hard for the Games, which for the first time will include breaking, or, as it\'s popularly known, breakdancing. Talash prances and swivels on her hands and feet to the beat of hip-hop, swooshing her black and red hair around before striking a pose signaling the end of her performance.\n\nJust months ago, she was working in a hair salon in the town of Huesca. Talash was among hundreds of Afghans brought to Spain aboard military planes following the return of the Taliban to power in August 2021.\n\nTalash first came across breaking at age 17. She saw a social media video of a man spinning on his head and was skeptical -- it must have been fake, generated by AI, she thought. But the images were real, and she said she soon became obsessed with the sport, scrolling through video after video on her phone.\n\n"I wanted to do it, I wanted to learn it," she said.\n\nShe found a club in Kabul where a dancer from the videos trained and knocked at the door. "There were 55 boys, and I was the only girl," she said. "I told myself, why can\'t a girl do this?"\n\nBreaking in some ways freed her from the problems facing young women in Afghanistan. But it wasn\'t long before Talash was noticed -- international news outlets published stories about the young Afghan woman defying cultural and religious norms. That was enough to become a target.\n\n"The Taliban don\'t like it when a girl dances," she said, even though breaking is more than that -- it\'s a sport.\n\nHer club began receiving threats, Talash said, and one day, when a bomb hit very close, local police asked them to shut down over the dangers.\n\nShe trained behind closed doors in her home until the Taliban\'s return to power. Despite initial promises that women\'s rights wouldn\'t be curtailed, women have since been barred from studying and face several restrictions on employment, travel and health.\n\n"Now, girls can\'t do anything," Talash said.\n\nShe\'s had little time to train while adapting to a foreign country, and at some points, competing in the Games seemed unfathomable.\n\n"But when my friend told me I could join the refugee team, I was so happy," Talash said. "I can now fly."\n\nMohammad Amin Alsalami, Syrian, athletics\n\nWhen Mohammad Amin Alsalami arrived in Berlin in October 2015, he was cold, lonely and homesick.\n\nThe Syrian refugee had left behind his war-torn hometown of Aleppo, fled to Turkey, crossed the Mediterranean on a rubber boat to Greece, and trekked by foot to Germany. Like millions of other migrants, he was in search of a place where he could build a future without bombs and violence.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Alsalami, 29, has been granted asylum, learned German and made new friends. And he\'s living his dream of becoming a world-class athlete.\n\nHe learned just months ago that he got the green light to participate in the Paris Games.\n\n"That moment was so wow," he said. "I get to go to the Olympics. I cried so much. It was really cool."\n\nAlsalami discovered his passion for athletics during physical education in school at age 15. A teacher noticed his talent for long jump and pushed him to participate in local and national competitions in Syria. But when civil war erupted, he could no longer practice. His family -- he\'s the youngest of nine siblings and comes from a family of tailors -- was displaced several times within Syria, then fled to Turkey. Alsalami decided to continue on to Europe on his own.\n\nHe credits his passion for athletics with getting him through the initial hardships in his new country.\n\nDuring the first weeks in Berlin, he looked up different stadiums and gyms on Google maps so he could start practicing long jump again. He remembers walking through the first snow to finally discover one of the city\'s big indoor gymnasiums.\n\n"All the other Berlin track and field athletes were training in this hall," he said. "When I came in and saw how full and how warm it was inside ... it was almost like paradise for me."\n\nOn that first day, a man watched him jump, approached him and asked something in German.\n\n"I didn\'t understand anything, not in English either," Alsalami said. "And then I said \'Hey, I\'m Syrian\' on my cellphone, and he said \'I\'m your trainer from now on.\'"\n\nHe stayed with that first coach for five years, then moved on to a different one -- and said he\'s eternally grateful to both for their support.\n\nDespite his excitement for the Games, Alsalami admits he\'s a bit sad that he can\'t represent his home country.\n\n"Syria is home, I miss it every day," he said. "In the end, that\'s my country, that\'s where I come from."\n\nIman Mahdavi, Iranian, wrestling\n\nIman Mahdavi smiles and dishes up Iranian food that he\'s cooked himself at his Milan home.\n\n"If my mum could see me now," he said with a laugh. "She wouldn\'t believe it."\n\nMahdavi hasn\'t seen his mother since October 2020, when the Iranian wrestler fled his home country over fears for his life.\n\nWith only the clothes he was wearing, Mahdavi made a harrowing journey by foot from Iran to Turkey, then flew to Italy and applied for asylum.\n\n"I didn\'t even really know where I was flying to," said Mahdavi, 29. "Luckily for me, it was Italy."\n\nOnce he was granted asylum, one of Mahdavi\'s first aims was to continue wrestling. His father, once a wrestler himself, had instilled in his son a passion. Mahdavi became a seven-time national junior champion and won more than 50 medals.\n\nThrough a friend he connected with on Instagram, Mahdavi was introduced to a gym on the outskirts of Milan.\n\n"As soon as we had him in the gym, in his first training sessions, we immediately saw that he was an extraordinary athlete, that he was a very, very high-level wrestler," said Giuseppe Gammarota, president of Lotta Club Seggiano. "We immediately started preparing him for competitions."\n\nThe gym has become like family to him -- so much so that he calls his coach, Marco Moroni, "Papi."\n\nMahdavi said his real father died of a heart attack several years ago after being mistakenly told his son died in a car crash.\n\nIt was Moroni who helped Mahdavi find a job, as a nightclub bouncer.\n\nMahdavi admits the schedule can be tough: He works from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., goes home to sleep, then trains every day. But he has a focus that drives him.\n\n"The Olympics is a dream for any athlete who does any sport," he said. "I hope to come back from the Olympics with the best colored medal I can get. And I will also be thinking about the next Olympics, hoping I\'m still in form."\n\n___\n\nBy MEGAN JANETSKY, RENATA BRITO, KIRSTEN GRIESHABER and DANIELLA MATAR Associated Press\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Rebecca Blackwell and Daniel Kozin in Cape Coral, Florida, and Iain Sullivan in Madrid contributed to this report.', 'source': {'uri': 'thenationalherald.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The National Herald'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'achilleas_kouremenos@thenationalherald.com', 'name': 'Achilleas Kouremenos', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24191829657160-scaled.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.05098039215686279, 'wgt': 458920556, 'relevance': 7}

One unique aspect of this game is its seasonal changes, which add a challenging twist.\n\nAs you near the end of the game on one server, you\'ll find yourself battling against a fixed time limit.

These structures can be saved as blueprints and carried over to the next season.

Usually dominant Napa American pitcher Landon Houle gave up singles to the first two batters, who both scored, and hit the third batter before retiring the next three. He had another shaky start in the second, allowing a walk and base hit to the first two batters before stranding both.\n\nNapa American got on the board in the second when Jake Tarap (2 for 2) walked and scored on a double by Will Wittmann (1 for 1, two walks, run scored). It tied the score at 2-2 in the fourth, when with two out Cordero Ochoa doubled and scored on a Tarap single.\n\nAfter Mill Valley went down 1-2-3 in the third.\n\nMill Valley went back ahead in the fourth, 3-2, by getting a run with three straight two-out hits. But Napa American knotted things up once again in the fifth, 3-3, when Lucas Wedding, Easton Hardy, Houle, Andrew Keller (2 for 2) and Jam Jam Duhig strung together five consecutive hits. Their team got only one run out of the barrage, however, because Mill Valley threw out two runners trying to score.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut Napa American took the lead for good with a three-spot in the top of the sixth. Brayden Bushby walked and was nabbed trying to advance to third base. But Ochoa singled and scored on a single by Tarap, who was thrown out at the plate for the second out. Wittmann walked and Jamie McWilliams singled, both scoring. Brix Leach singled and made his way around the bases before getting thrown out at the plate.\n\nMill Valley didn\'t make Bushby\'s save easy. Relieving Houle to start the sixth, he gave up a leadoff double. The next two batters were retired, including one by left fielder Talon Harley\'s long throw to first in time. A single put runners at the corners with the batter representing the tying run. But Bushby got the next batter to pop up to shortstop Leach to end the game.\n\n"I could feel a little pressure, the boys could feel a little pressure, but the end result was they pushed through. It\'s one of those things where they\'ve been behind before, and they kept their heads, they were level-headed, and they pushed through. We got to the sixth inning and back to the top of the order. We got a walk from Brayden and then we just kept hammering, base hit after base hit. They just got after it."\n\nHoule gave up five earned runs on seven hits, four strikeouts, one walk and one hit batter.\n\nWittman led the way in Sunday\'s 7-2 win over Petaluma National in the winners-bracket final. He pitched the first 5 1/3 innings and allowed three hits and two runs while striking out eight, before Leach came in to get the last two outs. Wittmann also went 2 for 2 at the plate with a solo homer, five total bases, an RBI, a walk and two runs scored.\n\n"Will really carried the team on the mound and got us on the board in the second inning with a monstrous home run to left field," Coach Bushby said. "Our defense had zero errors, which helped us keep Will in the game. It\'s such a huge thing to keep your pitch count down in tournament play and have your defense behind you. Will\'s velo was up and he kept pounding the zone. We are playing with a lot of confidence right now defensively and at the plate."\n\nOchoa was 2 for 2 with a walk, three stolen bases and two runs scored, Harley 2 for 3 with two runs scored, and Brayden Bushby 1 for 3 with a run scored. McWilliams walked and had two RBI.\n\n"Their pitcher had some good off-speed, but we were still able to make some good contact and put the ball in play. They just seemed to always find a defender," Coach Bushby said. "We had to manufacture a few runs with some small ball and being aggressive on the basepaths."\n\nDave Mosher contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

A total of 11 applied for the scholarships, which are either $600 or $500. The $600 scholarships are for the children or grandchildren of club members, while the $500 scholarships are for students outside of the club.\n\nThree of the nine recipients are children or grandchildren of Cool Spring Ruritan Club members and received the $600 award. Jana Whicker, daughter of member Jeff Whicker, and a student at Appalachian State University; Dakota York, grandson of Andy Tomlin; and Timber Hobbs, daughter of Billy Hobbs, received the $600 checks.

Hobbs, Ferrum College of Virginia; Mallory Kiser, Ferrum College of Virginia; Logan B. Lambert, MCC; Jacob Lister, Western Carolina; and Addison Reavis, Forsyth Tech Community College.\n\nBilly Hobbs, past president of the club, said the money for scholarships is the result of fundraisers the club holds throughout the year, including a chicken barbecue dinner. He said members get to the club building on Old Mocksville Road around 4 a.m. to cook the chicken and get things ready for the fundraiser, and then stay throughout the day selling the dinners and taking in the money.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHe told the students and their families at the club\'s meeting Monday that scholarship money is thanks to the men and women who give of their time and talents to raise the funds. Hobbs said that while the club was not able to fund all of the applications they hope to be able to do so in the future.\n\nDebbie Davis, past director of National Ruritan, encouraged the students to make the most of this opportunity. "Be the best you are capable of being," she said. The awarding of the scholarships, she said, shows the club believes in the students and in their potential.\n\nThree of the students were not able to attend the meeting but the mother of one, Timber Hobbs, said the money is appreciated. "We are grateful for the money and I know she is too," Kelly Hobbs said.\n\nLong-time member Roy Lazenby said giving out the scholarships is what Ruritan is all about. "It\'s all about giving," he said.\n\nWith this year\'s scholarships handed out, the Ruritan Club isn\'t taking time to rest before starting the fundraising efforts for next year\'s batch.\n\nThe first fundraiser planned is on Aug. 3 when the club will host a yard sale beginning at 7 a.m. Twenty spots are available for anyone wishing to sell items. To reserve a spot, call 704-437-1062. Anyone wishing to donate items for the yard sale can call 704-437-1062.

If the particulate count gets too high, it's a good time to change your filter. While all ZeroWater dispensers come with one filter, it's good to have backups.

Now, I truly hate him -- but I don\'t show it," O\'Reilly joked.\n\n"But you hold it very well," Stewart said.\n\nThere was only one topic to talk about Tuesday: the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the motive of which is still unknown.\n\nO\'Reilly called for calm, criticizing some, including a TV talk show, for what he said was emphasizing the fact that the alleged shooter was a registered Republican, to which Stewart pushed back.\n\n"You and I are both somewhat fossilized practitioners of the rhetorical arts that are confrontational at times, provocative at times," Stewart said. "And we made a really spectacular living pushing those envelopes."\n\nStewart and O\'Reilly have a history of on-air conflict, mirroring two opposite viewpoints, with O\'Reilly the conservative foil to Stewart, and vice versa.\n\nO\'Reilly last appeared on "The Daily Show" in 2014, when the two got into an animated discussion about race and white privilege. The pair previously had a 2012 charity debate dubbed "The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium."\n\nStewart left "The Daily Show" in 2015. O\'Reilly was dismissed by Fox in 2017 amid claims of sexual harassment. He denied the claims.\n\nStewart returned to "The Daily Show" this year to host Mondays only, with plans to host that night through the 2024 election.\n\n"The Daily Show" had been planned to be live from Milwaukee, where the Republican National Convention is being held, but stepped-up security following the attempted assassination of the former president meant there was no possibility of a live audience, Stewart said. Instead, it was moved to New York and there was no show Monday.\n\nStewart and O\'Reilly showed much of the same somewhat friendly back-and-forth Tuesday as they did in 2014.\n\nAfter O\'Reilly, who has written books about the assassinations of presidents, said that all of the assassins or would-be assassins in American history have been mentally ill, Stewart brought up President Abraham Lincoln\'s killer John Wilkes Booth.\n\n"Well, John Wilkes Booth was a fanatical conservative and racist who hated Lincoln," O\'Reilly began.\n\n"Good thing that\'s gone out of the country," Stewart joked, in one of the bigger laughs from the crowd in the interview.\n\nStewart opened Tuesday\'s show by mocking conspiratorial takes on X in the wake of the shooting. But in a serious moment, he admitted to searching social media after shocking acts of public violence, in part for personal and political reasons.\n\n"It\'s this pattern I feel like we now have in the country when we hear about a horrific event. You\'re on pins and needles in this sort of reverse demographic lottery to make sure that the psychopathic shooter doesn\'t belong to one of your teams," Stewart said.\n\n"And we\'re all doing it. We\'re all doing it," he said. "Because we have to know what our posture will be on the tragedy: Will it be a haughty \'I told you,\' or perhaps a circumspect, \'Oh, let\'s not rush to judgment. We shouldn\'t generalize.\'"\n\n"And then it ends up being someone we can\'t even f------ figure out in the first place," he said.', 'source': {'uri': 'aol.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Aol'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'phil_helsel@aol.com', 'name': 'Phil Helsel', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.pxiZP4As35Kg00Sf.qOsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_nbc_universal_184/1ff4a8c5c2bcbb9ca2a1b79e86cbe200', 'eventUri': 'eng-9738195', 'sentiment': -0.01960784313725494, 'wgt': 458915755, 'relevance': 55}

The network plans to broadcast the event across 17 channels, offering more live Olympic coverage than any other television network worldwide.\n\nThe Olympic Games, featuring around 10,500 athletes from 206 countries, will be extensively covered by BeIN Sports, providing nearly 100% live coverage of the events. Special attention will be given to Arab athletes participating in the Games, reflecting the numerous qualifiers from the MENA region.\n\nBeIN\'s pre-event coverage begins on July 19 with a nightly preview show, Welcome to Paris, airing at 22:30 MECCA on BeIN Sports 1.

Hundreds of events will take place over the course of a few weeks, many of them occurring simultaneously. It\'s a lot for any sports fan to keep up with. And this year, there are more places than ever to watch.\n\nIn the past, Olympics broadcasts have floundered when trying to satisfy audiences. NBC, the main broadcaster of the Olympics in the US, has gotten flak for its programming strategy during Games past by spreading the events out over too many TV channels and delaying some coverage until prime time instead of presenting the Games the way most people prefer to watch their sports: live. But this time, NBC and other broadcasters seem eager to make it much easier to find what you want to see, when you want to see it.\n\nOnline platforms are going for the gold this year as well. TikTok has an Olympics hub. In the weeks leading up tot the Games, the Instagram account @olympics has been posting training videos and action stills to its 8.2 million followers. NBC is partnering with creators across social media to cover events and to spin up content from Paris. Google will showcase live scores, medal ceremonies, and highlights within search results and inside the answers to queries handled by its Assistant. It\'s a full buffet.\n\n"We are going through a period where one of the most interesting, but to some extent also problematic, elements is the extreme segmentation of the audience," says Yiannis Exarchos, the CEO of the Olympic Broadcasting Service, the organization that produces and manages media output for the Olympics. "You have audiences all over the place, consuming content in different ways, and there are very few opportunities where you can really bring together large audiences."\n\nThe Olympics, he says, is one of those opportunities. The biggest change to Olympics coverage is that there is simply going to be much more of it. The total run time of the various competitions in the Olympic games will clock in at around 3,800 hours. The OBS plans to turn that into more than 11,000 hours of content -- a mixture of live coverage, behind-the-scenes features, narrated analysis, and highlights.\n\nAnyone tuning in will need a way to sift through it all. NBC wants to make that easier on its Peacock streaming platform and has debuted a bunch of new viewing options that will let users curate their own Olympics coverage, in addition streaming nearly every event live from the Olympics and the Paralympics. (The Paralympics, also taking place in Paris, start on August 28.)\n\nIn the Peacock Olympics hub, viewers can sort listings by sport, athlete, or country to find the events they want to watch and then add them to a watch list. This lets viewers create their own schedule to watch events live, as well as a place where they can come back to watch their chosen events later. Viewers can also watch up to four live events on the same screen using a new Multiview tool that makes it easy to flip between concurrent events.', 'source': {'uri': 'wired.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Wired'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'conde_nast@wired.com', 'name': 'Condé Nast', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': "https://media.wired.com/photos/6696dc2b6a7bb10e67ef7e43/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/This-Year's-Olympics-Broadcast-Will-Have-Crazy-Tech,-More-Drones,-and-Gobs-of-AI-GettyImages-2160036174.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", 'eventUri': 'eng-9739975', 'sentiment': 0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 458912237, 'relevance': 51}

The Guerrilla 450 is the company's new street naked motorcycle and this is the first time that they've forayed in the sub-500cc segment with this bike.\n\nThe design of the Royal Enfield Guerrilla 450, to begin with, is like the quintessential modern-retro motorcycle. You've got a round LED headlight, a 11-litre, teardrop shaped fuel tank and relatively slim tail section. There's a single-piece seat and a tubular grab handle for the pillion that's neatly integrated. On the whole the bike looks good and it comes in a variety of colours, some of which are quite bold.\n\nThe colours are segregated as per the variants- Flash, Dash and Analogue. The Flash variant gets the Brava Blue and Yellow Ribbon colours. The Dash variant comprises the Gold Dip and Playa Black while under Analogue you've got Smoke and Playa Black.\n\nPowering the bike is a 452cc, single-cylinder engine that makes 39.50bhp at 8,000rpm and 40Nm at 5,500rpm. It is paired with a six-speed gearbox.\n\nMoving on to the hardware, the Guerrilla 450 has a steel tubular frame that uses the engine as a stressed member. The frame is suspended by a 43mm telescopic fork with 140m travel and a preload adjustable monoshock with 150mm wheel travel. The bike rides on 17-inch wheels with a 120-section tyre at the front and a fat, 160-section tyre at the rear. These are Ceat Gripp XL tyres.\n\nBraking duties are taken care of by a 310mm disc at the front with a dual piston caliper while at the rear, there is a 270mm disc with a single-piston caliper. Dual-channel ABS is standard.\n\nThe Guerrilla 450 has a long wheelbase, at 1440mm while the ground clearance stands at 169mm. Its kerb weight is 185kg which is heavier than the competition like the Triumph Speed 400.\n\nAs for the features, the bike has all LED lights. The top variant gets the Himalayan's colour, TFT display with Bluetooth connectivity and Google based navigation. It gets the same ride modes as well. The base variant, on the other hand, has a analouge-digital instrument cluster with an optional Tripper navigation pod.\n\nWhile the Analogue variant, as we've mentioned, is priced at Rs 2.39 lakh, the mid-spec, Dash variant costs Rs 2.49 lakh, ex-showroom. The Flash variant, meanwhile, will set you back by Rs 2.54 lakh, ex-showroom.\n\nThe bike goes up against the the Triumph Speed 400 and Hero Mavrick 440.", 'source': {'uri': 'bikewale.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'bikewale.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'rishabh_bhaskar@bikewale.com', 'name': 'Rishabh Bhaskar', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x336/n/cw/ec/182233/royalenfield-guerrilla-450-right-side-view6.jpeg?isig=0&q=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-9739554', 'sentiment': 0.1686274509803922, 'wgt': 458911607, 'relevance': 5}

The race will not be held on the Davenport Riverfront.\n\nBut it still will go on.\n\nThe special event for runners and walkers ages 50 and over, one of the featured additions in celebration of the 50th running of the Quad-City Times Bix 7, now will be held at the Isle Casino Hotel in Bettendorf.\n\nThe race, scheduled for next Tuesday, July 23 at 6 p.m., still will feature a manageable distance, a nice, flat course and great views of the Mississippi River. It just will take place a few miles east of the original site, along the Bettendorf bike path.\n\n"We came up with the idea of this Senior Bix so we can include a lot of people that are getting older and can\'t run the whole race,\'\' said former Bix 7 race director Ed Froehlich, who is helping to plan the 50th anniversary festivities.

There will, however, be a massive post-race party in a covered parking area.\n\n"We\'ll have lots and lots of food just like we do at the regular Bix finish,\'\' Froehlich said. "We\'ll also have music and just a lot of things to do.\'\'\n\nMarathon legends Bill Rodgers and Frank Shorter, both of whom are 76, are expected to be among those participating in the event.\n\nRunners and walkers entering the Senior Bix also have the option of coming back for the regular Bix 7 race or the Prairie Farms Quick Bix on Saturday, July 27, at no additional cost.\n\nFroehlich emphasized that it is imperative for anyone planning to do the Senior Bix to arrive very, very early. A large turnout is expected and there is only one entrance to the Isle of Capri.\n\nBix 7 officials recommend participants be parked in the west parking lot by 5 p.m. and be at the starting line by 5:30. To access the west lot, turn right at the stop sign after crossing the Isle viaduct. To go to the North Tower, turn left.\n\n"We don\'t want to get people locked up on that viaduct and not get to go to the race,\'\' Froehlich said.\n\nRace packet pickup for the Senior Bix will be Saturday from 8 to 11 a.m. and Monday from 4 to 6 p.m. in the North Tower of the hotel. An additional packet pickup will be in the two hours leading up to the race, from 4 to 6 p.m. in the hotel west lot.\n\nPhotos: The Final Bix at 6 Practice Run 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'qctimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Quad-City Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'don_doxsie_newsroom@qctimes.com', 'name': 'Don Doxsie Newsroom', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/qctimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/e6/5e6f2204-4319-11ef-bc66-5341e3893099/6696be67433c8.preview.jpg?crop=1691%2C888%2C0%2C39&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.3333333333333333, 'wgt': 458911537, 'relevance': 26}

Speaking, with Joe La Puma, Ronaldinho talked about his first time meeting Michael Jordan for the first time. Ronaldinho shared that he met MJ in Barcelona, and Jordan gave him a special one-of-one version of Jordan PE. Ronaldinho called Jordan one of the greatest people he ever met and noted he still has the shoes.\n\nJoe La Puma: "Another meeting, 2006. Very jealous. Barcelona, you meet Michael Jordan. He laces you with these Jordan 21 PEs with the R10 on them. What was that meeting like and where are those shoes now?"\n\nRonaldinho: "That was special. Being with Jordan is always a special time. That was an unforgettable day. I still have those sneakers. He\'s one of the greatest people I\'ve ever met. It was undoubtedly an unforgettable day... Yes, of course! I still have them. They\'re safely kept in my house."\n\n2:28 onwards\n\nBoth Ronaldinho and Michael Jordan are two massive icons, not just in their respective sports, but in global pop culture. Ronaldinho is considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time and has won all the major tournaments possible in his career, including the World Cup, the Copa America, and the UEFA Champions League.\n\nAs for Michael Jordan, many in the world consider him the greatest basketball player of all time. Jordan dominated during his time in the NBA, winning 6 NBA championships and Finals MVP, 5 regular season MVPs, 1 Defensive Player of the Year award, along with 14 All-Star selections, 11 All-NBA selections, and 9 All-Defensive selections.\n\nMichael Jordan Is An Enigma To The Public\n\nAnother soccer icon, Lionel Messi, called Michael Jordan the greatest athlete in history. Messi is perhaps one of the few other figures in the sports world that can claim that title for himself, but he showed the incredible amount of reverence and respect he has for Jordan by giving him that title.\n\nSo many stories fans get to hear about Michael Jordan only add to the myth and the legend surrounding His Airness. Jordan leads an incredibly private lifestyle and doesn\'t do many public appearances or interviews, so these stories are a good glimpse into the kind of person MJ is, and the kind of lifestyle he leads.\n\nRecently, an influencer shed some light on what it is like to attend a Michael Jordan party. She noted that he spares no expense, but is also incredibly selective and secretive about who gets invited and what people are able to attend.\n\nFormer Hornets star Kemba Walker told a story of why he would never gamble with Michael Jordan. Jordan is known to enjoy games of chance regularly, and Walker noted that he couldn\'t keep up with the amount of money Jordan was gambling, and didn\'t want to risk his finances just to match Jordan.\n\nMichael Jordan is unlikely to ever change his lifestyle to accommodate the media or the public. And considering the scrutiny he dealt with during his playing days, it makes sense why he shies away from the media. Till the day comes when MJ decides to address it all publically, we have to rely on these stories to know more about Michael Jordan.\n\nRelated: Ex-Player Slams LeBron For Abusing Power To Force Bronny In The NBA: "MJ Stands On Earned, Not Given"\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

"Advertisers are actively asking \'what can we do to include ourselves with women\'s events,\'" he said.\n\nAdvertiser demand for women\'s sports has grown to a point where GroupM, one of the world\'s largest ad-buying agencies, is now working with NBCUniversal to create new advertising packages that will allow some of GroupM\'s brand clients to specifically appear during women\'s Paris Olympic events, the agency told Reuters exclusively.\n\nThe fan frenzy for U.S. basketball player Caitlin Clark, whose success was credited with driving higher ratings for the women\'s college basketball championship than the men\'s for the first time, is one reason for the increased attention on women\'s sports, the ad experts said.\n\nWhile Clark was not selected for the Olympic basketball team, she and other female athletes are dominating sports-related ads ahead of the Paris Games.\n\nSimone Biles, the most decorated gymnast of all time, is currently starring in several brand campaigns including for diabetes drug Mounjaro and athletic clothing brand Athleta, according to data from TV ad measurement firm iSpot.\n\nIn the Athleta commercial with the tagline "The Power of She," Biles trains alone in a gym, sticking a perfect landing after a flip as her voiceover says "we are here ... for hearing yourself over the crowd and landing in your power."\n\nOlympic swimmer Katie Ledecky, who has seven gold medals, also features in Athleta\'s campaign on social media, as well as TV commercials for protein drink Core Power and sportswear brand TYR.\n\nThe Paris Olympics begin on July 26.\n\nDOUBLE SPENDING\n\nIn March, GroupM said it pledged to double its annual ad spending on women\'s sports, backed by some of its clients including Google, Mars and Unilever.\n\n"I\'ve had many conversations with clients who haven\'t been involved with women\'s sports in the past, who are now thinking and acting on it," said Matt Sweeney, chief investment officer at GroupM U.S.\n\nBeyond categories such as personal care items, advertisers in the travel, pharmaceutical and insurance industries are increasingly interested in women\'s sports, said Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal\'s head of global advertising and partnerships.\n\nDespite the growth in attention for women\'s sports, the size of sponsorship deals for female athletes are still far off from their male counterparts, said Robert Müller von Vultejus, chief growth officer at sports marketing agency Sportfive.\n\n"The individual reach of an athlete like LeBron James is so outstanding, it\'s not yet comparable on the women\'s side," he said. "But in a couple years time, it will get there."\n\n\'PERFECT STORM\'\n\nContinued viewership and support of women\'s sports beyond the Olympics will be key to maintaining the momentum, said Kerri Walsh Jennings, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in beach volleyball.\n\n"If brands say they support female athletes, but don\'t put action behind it, it falls flat," she said. "I hope brands continue showing up and giving us this platform."\n\nJennings appears in a social media campaign beginning this week for Bingo Blitz, an online game from developer Playtika, alongside two-time Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman and American soccer player Alex Morgan.

Perhaps the sycophants will cease feeding Wes\'s ego if you desist from stealing his lunch.\n\nI don\'t think we\'ve been in the office the same day since minicamp over a month ago. I\'m actually starting to miss him.\n\nMarcus from Plover, WI\n\nHow do you see us going up against division opponents this year?\n\nTraining camp is almost here and no Jordan Love contract. Is it time to panic yet?\n\nNot a question, but some advice. I just finished Cliff Christl\'s four-volume set about the history of the Packers. I give it an A++. Very in-depth. I\'d advise any fan, Packers or otherwise, to check it out.\n\nI made it a point this offseason to start reading that, and I got through the first two volumes. Next offseason\'s goal will be the final two.\n\nJoe from Eau Claire, WI\n\nMike, RE: your answer to Rich from El Cerrito on press box etiquette, I was in the "auxiliary" press box on Christmas Eve 1995 when Yancey Thigpen dropped Neil O\'Donnell\'s sure TD pass. There were actually reporters BEATING on the box\'s windows! The following week against Atlanta (wild-card playoff at Lambeau), EVERY media kit folder contained a tersely worded memo from Mr. Lee Remmel...scolding those responsible, and warning of credential cancellation if such behavior was observed again.\n\nI want to say similar steps were taken again at some point during the \'97 season, which was the year I witnessed what I described. I was embarrassed for those who were reprimanded, honestly, but unfortunately more so than they were embarrassed for themselves.\n\nSue from Three Lakes, WI\n\nSo, if we sign a player from another team\'s practice squad we must sign him to our 53. Can he stay on our 53 for a game or two and then go to our practice squad?\n\nOnly if he clears waivers first and agrees to return to the practice squad. But any PS player signed by another team to its active roster is guaranteed three weeks of active roster pay first.\n\nChuck from Menomonie, WI\n\nDo you have any insights on the communication process between GM and head coach during preseason? Would a GM say, "I need to see Player X lined up at inside LB against Cleveland\'s starters," or something like that? It dawns on me that the needs of the GM might not always match those of the head coach.\n\nPlaying time and opportunities for evaluation in preseason games are discussed quite a bit. How specifically those opportunities are outlined and planned I can\'t really say. But I don\'t see it as any disconnect between GM and head coach. In the preseason, players are viewed as either preparing for the regular season or fighting for depth/roster spots. Personnel and coaching have similar goals in mind.\n\nChris from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\nI really liked Mike\'s answer about the three-technique, five-technique question. It was quite informative. As a follow up, why is it called "technique" if it\'s more about the location that the guys line up in? Thanks for always teaching us!\n\nI don\'t know where "technique" came from as it applies to alignment. But that\'s the common term.\n\nTim from Olathe, KS\n\nInsiders, sometimes when the offense comes to the line of scrimmage, it appears the center is talking to his teammates. What is he talking about? Is he interfering with the QB\'s cadence or audibles?\n\nNo, he\'s usually declaring to his teammates who the "mike," or middle linebacker, is based on the defensive alignment, because the offense\'s protection call is based on identifying the "mike" and counting out each way from the middle.\n\nWesley from Woodbury, MN\n\nGood morning II, when the offense makes a substitution, the refs will hold up the snap until the defense has time to make a substitution. Is there a time limit the defense has to make this substitution or can they "drag their feet" to run down the play clock? Thanks for all of your insights!\n\nThe substitution has to be immediate, with the player(s) running on/off the field right away. If there\'s any delay, the official can simply step back and let the offense run the play.\n\nRobert from Corpus Christi, TX\n\nWhy don\'t NFL teams have summer practices at Wisconsin universities anymore?\n\nIt was quite the run, wasn\'t it? Bears in my hometown of Platteville from 1984-2000, Saints in La Crosse from 1988-99, Chiefs in River Falls from 1991-2009, and the Jaguars had their inaugural camp in Stevens Point in 1995. They all left for various reasons - staying closer to home, less overall expense, easier for their own fans to attend, local economic impact, etc. - and as teams improved their own facilities over the years, they became better equipped to deal with the heat (the main reason the Saints and Chiefs wanted to train further north all those years, though the Jaguars escaped nothing with that scorching \'95 Midwest heat wave and never came back), plus the amenities of their home facilities became more difficult to replicate elsewhere. But the Cheese League will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nDave from Gwinn, MI\n\nI tried googling this but Google is dumber than a box of wet sweat socks. Donald Driver was a great seventh-round pick (would\'ve also been a great first-round pick), but was he the greatest seventh-round pick in GB history? Who were some other notable seventh-round steals?\n\nSince the draft was reduced to seven rounds in \'94, the selection of Driver in \'99 was the best seventh-round pick by the Packers. The next five on my list would be (in chronological order) Adam Timmerman in \'95, Mark Tauscher in 2000, Scott Wells in \'04, Matt Flynn in \'08, and Rasheed Walker in \'22.\n\nKyle from St. Charles, MO\n\nIt\'s hard to believe by this time next week they\'ll have their first practice of 2024 behind them. Feels like yesterday they were just in Santa Clara. Is there any news regarding current injuries and recovery heading into camp or will you find out more on Wednesday?\n\nWe will find out more information when we hear from Coach LaFleur and/or when we see the first practice. Even though rookies are reporting a few days early, there\'s no media access this week.\n\nMonty from Velva, ND\n\nWith the switch from a 3-4 to a 4-3, it got me wondering about the transition for OLB to DE and vice versa. I remember Aaron Kampman struggling with the change to OLB. Do you think it is easier to change from OLB to DE or DE to OLB?\n\nI would guess the former. Outside \'backers in a 3-4 have pass coverage responsibilities that D-ends in a 4-3 generally don\'t. So while one transition adds to a player\'s plate, the other subtracts from it.\n\nBob from Covington, KY\n\nRewatched last year\'s 49ers game on the NFL Network yesterday. Joe Barry\'s defense held the Niners to 24 points and if the Packers hadn\'t missed a couple hundred tackles, it might have been 14. I\'m looking forward to a more aggressive defense this season but it still comes down to execution. Seems to me the scheme isn\'t nearly as important as the guys doing their jobs. It\'ll be interesting, and hopefully fun, to watch what develops.\n\nIt\'s always first and foremost about the players. Scheme and coaching can help get the most out of them, but the players are the ones who must get the job done. As for the Niners game, holding them to 17 points in the first 54 minutes was commendable. Allowing a 5-minute, 69-yard TD drive at crunch time - during which the only third downs were third-and-1, third-and-5, and third-and-1 - was not.\n\nUnder Matt LaFleur? 3-2. Under Mike McCarthy it was 9-4, Mike Sherman 3-3, Ray Rhodes 1-0 and Mike Holmgren 5-2. That\'s 21-11 dating back to 1992.\n\nThere are several candidates. Quay Walker, Devonte Wyatt and Lukas Van Ness seem the most likely suspects to me.\n\nMichael from Baraboo, WI\n\nWhat are the biggest final roster battles that we can look forward to watching this summer?\n\nIn no particular order: RG, CB2, QB2, RB2, WR5-6, and K are the most noteworthy in my book.\n\nClipton from Pasadena, CA\n\nMike, not sure if you\'re still accepting dead zone questions ... Crappies: worms, minnows, or jigs?\n\nMike, not sure how many Brewer games you made but your chance of seeing a win was slim. If ever a team needed a break it\'s the Crew. Hopefully the reports are correct about some pitchers returning soon.\n\nThat would be nice. I went to four games last week and saw only one win, but the law of averages was bound to catch up with me. I was 5-0 previously this year and therefore finished my spring/summer 6-3.\n\nCraig from Sussex, WI\n\nWhat is Spoff\'s favorite baseball book? Mine is "Babe" by Robert Creamer.\n\nIt\'s hard to narrow down the list, but "Moneyball," "Eight Men Out," "Game of Shadows," and "One Shot At Forever" all rank up there for me.\n\nDavid from Vicksburg, MI\n\nHow long will it take to put in the new defense and get everyone playing on the same page?\n\nTo repurpose one of Vic\'s favorite Chuck Noll quotes: Nobody knows.\n\nBob from Emmaus, PA\n\nI believe that the Packers have added talent that will have immediate impact to a good team and made positive changes to the coaching and training staff. When should we start getting excited about the upcoming season?\n\nWhenever you want, but be cognizant the baloney doesn\'t officially stop until the ball is on the tee in Brazil. Or take a quick listen to Mark.\n\nMark from Westminster, CO\n\nAs we near Packers training camp, I\'m always reminded of Allen Iverson\'s practice rant. "We sitting in here - I\'m supposed to be the franchise player, and we in here talking about practice. I mean, listen: We talking about practice. Not a game. Not a game. Not a game. We talking about practice. Not a game. Not the game that I go out there and die for and play every game like it\'s my last. Not the game. We talking about practice, man."

Otherwise, Saban approves of Sarkisian\'s roster.\n\n"I really like Texas," Saban said.\n\nApparently, Alabama retained Saban on the payroll to feed Texas rat poison.\n\nAnd what of Texas\' influence off the field? Texas wielded the biggest stick at the Big 12\'s decision-making table. Saban suggested that stick won\'t carry as much thwack inside the SEC\'s board room.\n\n"They\'re not going to run the SEC," he said. "There\'s a whole lot of arrogant people in a lot of places in the SEC, so they can forget all about that."\n\nTOPPMEYER: Waiting on Alabama\'s Kalen DeBoer to wilt in Nick Saban shadow? Think again\n\nHmm, we\'ll see about that. I expect Texas\' clout will remain mighty.\n\nAs for Texas\' football team, Saban thinks they\'ll get on fine in their new digs.\n\n"They\'ll be a good team and a great program," Saban said, "and Sark will do a great job."\n\nAnd Texas will become the SEC\'s best addition ever.\n\nTexas played a role in the Southwest Conference\'s demise. Its overbearing grip on the Big 12 contributed to that conference\'s yearslong distrust and dysfunction.\n\nIn the SEC, though, Texas\' bravado won\'t be out of place. The Longhorns found a conference that will embrace their ample ego.', 'source': {'uri': 'sports.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SY5e5KqSEKmCq7ig10IoHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/austin-american-statesman/c0661e7497fb4e140b87538206119b2e', 'eventUri': 'eng-9737433', 'sentiment': 0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 458908445, 'relevance': 51}

"Advertisers are actively asking \'what can we do to include ourselves with women\'s events,´" he said.\n\nAdvertiser demand for women´s sports has grown to a point where GroupM, one of the world´s largest ad-buying agencies, is now working with NBCUniversal to create new advertising packages that will allow some of GroupM´s brand clients to specifically appear during women´s Paris Olympic events, the agency told Reuters exclusively.\n\nThe fan frenzy for U.S. basketball player Caitlin Clark, whose success was credited with driving higher ratings for the women\'s college basketball championship than the men\'s for the first time, is one reason for the increased attention on women´s sports, the ad experts said.\n\nWhile Clark was not selected for the Olympic basketball team, she and other female athletes are dominating sports-related ads ahead of the Paris Games.\n\nSimone Biles, the most decorated gymnast of all time, is currently starring in several brand campaigns including for diabetes drug Mounjaro and athletic clothing brand Athleta, according to data from TV ad measurement firm iSpot.\n\nIn the Athleta commercial with the tagline "The Power of She," Biles trains alone in a gym, sticking a perfect landing after a flip as her voiceover says "we are here ... for hearing yourself over the crowd and landing in your power."\n\nOlympic swimmer Katie Ledecky, who has seven gold medals, also features in Athleta´s campaign on social media, as well as TV commercials for protein drink Core Power and sportswear brand TYR.\n\nThe Paris Olympics begin on July 26.\n\nDOUBLE SPENDING\n\nIn March, GroupM said it pledged to double its annual ad spending on women´s sports, backed by some of its clients including Google, Mars and Unilever.\n\n"I´ve had many conversations with clients who haven´t been involved with women´s sports in the past, who are now thinking and acting on it," said Matt Sweeney, chief investment officer at GroupM U.S.\n\nBeyond categories such as personal care items, advertisers in the travel, pharmaceutical and insurance industries are increasingly interested in women´s sports, said Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal´s head of global advertising and partnerships.\n\nDespite the growth in attention for women´s sports, the size of sponsorship deals for female athletes are still far off from their male counterparts, said Robert Müller von Vultejus, chief growth officer at sports marketing agency Sportfive.\n\n"The individual reach of an athlete like LeBron James is so outstanding, it´s not yet comparable on the women´s side," he said. "But in a couple years time, it will get there."\n\n\'PERFECT STORM\'\n\nContinued viewership and support of women´s sports beyond the Olympics will be key to maintaining the momentum, said Kerri Walsh Jennings, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in beach volleyball.\n\n"If brands say they support female athletes, but don\'t put action behind it, it falls flat," she said. "I hope brands continue showing up and giving us this platform."\n\nJennings appears in a social media campaign beginning this week for Bingo Blitz, an online game from developer Playtika, alongside two-time Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman and American soccer player Alex Morgan.

It was also the biggest disappointment he ever suffered in his career as a distance runner.\n\nItalian-American Vincent Ciattei was being interviewed minutes after he finished his Olympic qualifier final race at Haywood Field in Oregon. He had run his 1500 meters in a time of 3:31.78, almost 3 seconds faster than the record for that race. For this achievement it was a time of joy, pride and celebration. But he finished 1/4 second behind the third place runner.\n\nThe dreaded 4th place finish meant Ciattei would not be going to the Paris Olympics. Any other year, he would have been an Olympian.\n\nRacing experts called it the greatest and deepest race in the history of U.S. Olympic trials. The first 8 contestants, all National Medalists now, bested the old record. The stunning victory went to Cole Hocker in 3:30.59\n\nPeople are also reading...

The video -- easily found on YouTube -- is filled with powerful and moving facial expressions, voice intonations, sighs, smiles and gestures.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAt the opening, his downcast eyes, his tone and hand gestures bespeak his own bewilderment. Smashing a record time while coming in 4th was "hard to swallow." But then his eyes light up as he forcefully states that the race was a testament to the greatness of the three athletes who placed higher. He was justly proud of the effort he put in all year to get to the trials.\n\nHis critique of his race: maybe he could have run more wisely in the last 200 yards. That\'s when rival Hobbs Kessler stole that one step he needed to outlast Ciattei down the home stretch. Then, in a confessional tone, the runner stated flatly that he gave all he had, his absolute limit.\n\nBut like an athlete getting a second wind, he let us know: "This doesn\'t mean my year is over." He was off to St. Moritz for European competition beginning at Monaco Diamond League -- the highest level of professional racing in the world. On July 19, Ciattei will race in London with the Diamond League.\n\nThe road to his position today had been a rocky one. After graduating from Virginia Tech, Ciattei chose to run professionally, forsaking a lucrative career in business/engineering. He struggled through bouts of serious injuries that easily could have ended his career. In 2021, he made the Olympic trials but just before the finals, he suffered yet another serious injury and his run for 2021 glory ended.\n\nWas it time to end his Olympic quest? Emphatically, no! "To quit would have been self-betrayal," he told me. In 2023, at age 28, Ciattei won his first championship, the USATF National Road Mile. Seven of his 10 personal best marks came between August \'23 and May, \'24. And, at age 29, he ran his best race ever at the \'24 trials.\n\nAmong the factors fueling his determination to stay the course has been the support from his large Italian-American family. The Ciattei family traces its roots to the Trento region in Italy. Vincent has combined traditional Italian qualities of working hard and striving for excellence with a never-say-die attitude and a willingness to butt heads when necessary.\n\nIf fate is fair, and I believe it is, then Vincent Ciattei is headed for the very best of times in his professional running career.\n\n0 Comments Catch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'buffalonews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Buffalo News'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/bc/abcb1068-42be-11ef-acf9-cf02958171f1/66954ec702d0b.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 458907841, 'relevance': 51}

Athletics foster a sense of resilience and camaraderie among vulnerable individuals stripped of their identities, homes and humanity.\n\nAcross refugee camps in Denmark and Greece, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of sports. Athletics extended beyond mere recreation restore dignity and empower refugees to reclaim their humanity. Establishing a global refugee fund, dedicated to supporting and promoting sports and education initiatives in refugee camps, under the patronage of the United Nations, could promote a higher quality of life and increase survival mentality.\n\nRefugee camps are spatially and temporally bound, yet they harbor stories of strength that defy odds. In Denmark\'s Avnstrup asylum camp, I met a 17-year-old young man seeking asylum from Iran. He has spent the last nine years of his life in refugee camps, five of those in Avnstrup. His talents in soccer earned him a place in a Danish athletics boarding school, a small escape from the harsh realities of everyday camp life. However, when he turns 18, the authorities will strip his fundamental right to education and the sport that gives him hope. The majority of young refugees, like this young soccer player, languish in camps devoid of recreational and educational opportunities, their dreams oppressed by systemic neglect and administrative limitations.\n\nIn contrast, the Paréa refugee solidarity center sits opposite the harsh Kara Tepe refugee camp in Lesvos, Greece. Upon arriving at Paréa, the presence of color on the murals, signs and buildings immediately stands out as the antithesis to the bleak refugee camp down the road. Inside, laughter and the thud of basketballs echo. At Paréa, near the scorched camp grounds, sports emerge as the catalyst for healing and camaraderie. My classmates and I were quickly ushered into pickup basketball and volleyball games, not speaking the same language as our teammates, but communicating through the universal language of sport. Later, using Google Translate, I engaged in banter with a Somali refugee about the football rivalry between my beloved Manchester United and his cherished Manchester City. I recognized a pattern: refugees finding solace through sport -- a language unbound by camps or borders.\n\nBy harnessing the power of sports in these communities, we can attend to psychosocial needs and uplift refugees. First, sports can act as a therapeutic outlet for refugees struggling to cope with the uncertainty and trauma that permeate their lives. Through playing friendly matches or watching championship games, refugees can find solace in the joy of sports and a sense of belonging in the face of adversity. Studies attest to the positive impact of sports on mental health, psychosocial well-being, social integration and resilience.\n\nSecond, integrating educational components into sports programs in camps can promote the pursuit of knowledge. Introducing literacy classes or vocational training workshops alongside volleyball practice or soccer tournaments could instill a sense of purpose within the mundane routines of camp life.\n\nThe international Education Above All Foundation: reported: "When education and sports are integrated, they can have increased beneficial impact, helping countries more rapidly achieve sustainable development goals, including improved health and well-being, social inclusion and cohesion, and more peaceful and prosperous communities and nations."\n\nRegular physical activity provides significant physical and mental health benefits. A study looking at the impact of exercise and sports on mental health in a Greek refugee camp found that sports positively impacted mental health outcomes for refugees, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and health-related challenges to our quality of life.\n\nThe United Nations has previously recognized global rights to education and sports. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from 1948 states the universal right to education, directed "to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms." The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child from 1989 states that education includes the development of physical abilities and the right to participate in recreational activities.\n\nThe establishment of a U.N. global fund dedicated to integrating sport and education initiatives into refugee camps is imperative to improve the well-being of refugees in vulnerable situations. Under the U.N.\'s auspices, this fund would support existing sports programs while facilitating the integration of educational components. Partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, corporate sponsors and international sporting organizations could bolster these initiatives\' widespread reach and visibility. An official sports organization could work with the U.N. to support specific initiatives tied to their respective sports and promote them within their clubs.\n\nManaging the global refugee crisis and meeting humanitarian needs is a nuanced and multifaceted challenge. Yet through investment in sport and education initiatives within refugee camps, we can reaffirm displaced individuals\' dreams and humanity. I urge global citizens, policymakers and humanitarian organizations to join me in supporting the creation of a fund that would promote sports and education programs in refugee camps, and reshape the experiences of people just like that 17-year-old I talked to, who deserve dignity, respect and hope.', 'source': {'uri': 'yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/kansas_city_star_mcclatchy_articles_677/6c2eba3c81ff2073169c031d02acf37a', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 458907727, 'relevance': 51}

Later, using Google Translate, I engaged in banter with a Somali refugee about the football rivalry between my beloved Manchester United and his cherished Manchester City. I recognized a pattern: refugees finding solace through sport -- a language unbound by camps or borders.\n\nBy harnessing the power of sports in these communities, we can attend to psychosocial needs and uplift refugees. First, sports can act as a therapeutic outlet for refugees struggling to cope with the uncertainty and trauma that permeate their lives. Through playing friendly matches or watching championship games, refugees can find solace in the joy of sports and a sense of belonging in the face of adversity. Studies attest to the positive impact of sports on mental health, psychosocial well-being, social integration and resilience.\n\nSecond, integrating educational components into sports programs in camps can promote the pursuit of knowledge. Introducing literacy classes or vocational training workshops alongside volleyball practice or soccer tournaments could instill a sense of purpose within the mundane routines of camp life.\n\nThe international Education Above All Foundation: reported: "When education and sports are integrated, they can have increased beneficial impact, helping countries more rapidly achieve sustainable development goals, including improved health and well-being, social inclusion and cohesion, and more peaceful and prosperous communities and nations."\n\nRegular physical activity provides significant physical and mental health benefits. A study looking at the impact of exercise and sports on mental health in a Greek refugee camp found that sports positively impacted mental health outcomes for refugees, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and health-related challenges to our quality of life.\n\nThe United Nations has previously recognized global rights to education and sports. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from 1948 states the universal right to education, directed "to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms." The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child from 1989 states that education includes the development of physical abilities and the right to participate in recreational activities.\n\nThe establishment of a U.N. global fund dedicated to integrating sport and education initiatives into refugee camps is imperative to improve the well-being of refugees in vulnerable situations. Under the U.N.\'s auspices, this fund would support existing sports programs while facilitating the integration of educational components. Partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, corporate sponsors and international sporting organizations could bolster these initiatives\' widespread reach and visibility. An official sports organization could work with the U.N. to support specific initiatives tied to their respective sports and promote them within their clubs.\n\nManaging the global refugee crisis and meeting humanitarian needs is a nuanced and multifaceted challenge. Yet through investment in sport and education initiatives within refugee camps, we can reaffirm displaced individuals\' dreams and humanity. I urge global citizens, policymakers and humanitarian organizations to join me in supporting the creation of a fund that would promote sports and education programs in refugee camps, and reshape the experiences of people just like that 17-year-old I talked to, who deserve dignity, respect and hope.', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.news.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/kansas_city_star_mcclatchy_articles_677/6c2eba3c81ff2073169c031d02acf37a', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 458907498, 'relevance': 51}

"Advertisers are actively asking \'what can we do to include ourselves with women\'s events,\'" he said.\n\nAdvertiser demand for women\'s sports has grown to a point where GroupM, one of the world\'s largest ad-buying agencies, is now working with NBCUniversal to create new advertising packages that will allow some of GroupM\'s brand clients to specifically appear during women\'s Paris Olympic events, the agency told Reuters exclusively.\n\nThe fan frenzy for U.S. basketball player Caitlin Clark, whose success was credited with driving higher ratings for the women\'s college basketball championship than the men\'s for the first time, is one reason for the increased attention on women\'s sports, the ad experts said.\n\nWhile Clark was not selected for the Olympic basketball team, she and other female athletes are dominating sports-related ads ahead of the Paris Games.\n\nSimone Biles, the most decorated gymnast of all time, is currently starring in several brand campaigns including for diabetes drug Mounjaro and athletic clothing brand Athleta, according to data from TV ad measurement firm iSpot.\n\nIn the Athleta commercial with the tagline "The Power of She," Biles trains alone in a gym, sticking a perfect landing after a flip as her voiceover says "we are here ... for hearing yourself over the crowd and landing in your power."\n\nOlympic swimmer Katie Ledecky, who has seven gold medals, also features in Athleta\'s campaign on social media, as well as TV commercials for protein drink Core Power and sportswear brand TYR.\n\nIn March, GroupM said it pledged to double its annual ad spending on women\'s sports, backed by some of its clients including Google, Mars and Unilever.\n\n"I\'ve had many conversations with clients who haven\'t been involved with women\'s sports in the past, who are now thinking and acting on it," said Matt Sweeney, chief investment officer at GroupM U.S.\n\nBeyond categories such as personal care items, advertisers in the travel, pharmaceutical and insurance industries are increasingly interested in women\'s sports, said Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal\'s head of global advertising and partnerships.\n\nDespite the growth in attention for women\'s sports, the size of sponsorship deals for female athletes are still far off from their male counterparts, said Robert Müller von Vultejus, chief growth officer at sports marketing agency Sportfive.\n\n"The individual reach of an athlete like LeBron James is so outstanding, it\'s not yet comparable on the women\'s side," he said. "But in a couple years time, it will get there."\n\n\'PERFECT STORM\'\n\nContinued viewership and support of women\'s sports beyond the Olympics will be key to maintaining the momentum, said Kerri Walsh Jennings, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in beach volleyball.\n\n"If brands say they support female athletes, but don\'t put action behind it, it falls flat," she said. "I hope brands continue showing up and giving us this platform."\n\nJennings appears in a social media campaign beginning this week for Bingo Blitz, an online game from developer Playtika, alongside two-time Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman and American soccer player Alex Morgan. The three athletes each describe a consequential time in their career as their "bingo" moment.\n\n"Years ago, people would say no one really watches women\'s sports. That\'s not the case now," said Nancy Atufunwa, senior vice president at sports marketing agency Octagon, citing the popularity of college level sports and the WNBA.

TikTok can appeal against the ruling within two months and 10 days of the decision.\n\nTikTok had insisted it was the "most capable challenger" to entrenched players in the digital sphere, but the court dismissed that argument.\n\n"TikTok had succeeded in increasing its number of users very rapidly and exponentially, reaching, in a short time, half the size of Facebook and of Instagram, and a particularly high engagement rate, with young users in particular, who spent more time on TikTok than on other social networks," the court said in a statement.\n\nThe judges acknowledged that in 2018, video sharing app TikTok was indeed a challenger but it had since then "rapidly consolidated its position and even strengthened that position over the following years" despite the launch of similar rival services.\n\n- Unhappy big tech -\n\n"We are disappointed with this decision. TikTok is a challenger platform that provides important competition to incumbent players," a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n"While we will now evaluate next steps, we already took measures to comply with the relevant obligations of the DMA ahead of last March\'s deadline."\n\nBut the court determined "ByteDance met the quantitative thresholds laid down in the DMA".\n\nFor Brussels to name a company as a gatekeeper, they must fulfil certain conditions.\n\nThe criteria include having more than 45 million monthly active users in the EU and more than 10,000 yearly active business users established in the bloc.\n\nDigital companies with an annual turnover in the EU of at least 7.5 billion euros ($8.2 billion) or a market value of above 75 billion euros also face the new curbs.\n\nIf a company violates the law, the EU can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company\'s total global turnover. This can rise to 20 percent for repeat offenders and in the most severe circumstances, the EU can order the break-up of companies.\n\nIt is the second defeat in the courts for TikTok over the DMA. It lost a bid in February to suspend the strict new rules pending the judgement handed down Wednesday.\n\nBig tech is not happy about the new law. Apple, contesting the DMA in the courts, has been vocal in its criticism, saying it puts users\' security at risk.\n\nraz/js\n\nMore from this section\n\nAsset Defense Team and Vast Solutions Group Announce a New Joint Venture for Asset Protection and Tax Strategy\n\nSen.

The forum, hosted by international law firm Clark Hill in collaboration with the Fédération Internationale de l\'Automobile (FIA), founders of the UAOA coalition, highlighted the growing epidemic of online hate speech targeting athletes.\n\nChaired by the \'Off the Ball\' presenter Ger Gilroy, the forum featured prominent Irish sports stars Jenny Claffey (Ireland Padel & former Ireland Tennis player), Leah Tarpey (Leinster & Ireland Rugby player), and Tom Parsons (Chief Executive of the Gaelic Players Association and former Mayo county player). Clark Hill is the legal advisor to the UAOA coalition.\n\nOne of the key proposals discussed amongst the 50 attendees was the establishment under the EU Digital Services Act of an international Trusted Flagger entity for sports organisations to fast track complaints and take down notices of abusive comments on online platforms. Once established the online platforms would be required to agree protocols and processes for policing online abuse with the Trusted Flagger entity.\n\nSenior representatives present from major sports sponsors; the Irish Mental Health Commission and national and international sports bodies called for immediate action and said that Ireland is the obvious choice for such an international entity. Ireland has an experienced and robust regaulatory and legal system with the expertise necessary said Kirby Tarrant, Partner In Charge at Clark Hill. Dublin already hosts the EMEA headquarters for social media giants such as Google; Meta/Facebook; Twitter and LinkedIn. Other Very Large Online Platforms have a major presence here also.\n\nArticle 22 of the Digital Services Act sets out that providers of online platforms shall take the necessary technical and organisational measures to ensure that notices submitted by Trusted Flagger acting within their designated area of expertise are given priority and processed and decided upon without undue delay.\n\nUnder the DSA , the status of \'trusted flagger\' shall be awarded, on application by an entity to an applicant that has demonstrated that it has (a) It has particular expertise and competence for the purposes of detecting, identifying and notifying illegal content; (b) It is independent from any provider of online platforms; (c) It carries out its activities for the purposes of submitting notices diligently, accurately and objectively.\n\nThe United Against Online Abuse forum highlighted the urgent need for a unified approach to combating online abuse, aiming to protect the integrity of sport and the well-being of athletes.\n\n"Imagine training your entire life for a dream only to be bombarded with threats and hate online. That\'s the reality for 75% of athletes today," stated Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President of the FIA and founder of the UAOA coalition, in his opening remarks at the forum. "If we remain idle and athletes are driven from their sports due to online abuse, we will lose the very spirit of competition. Today, a force of good rises with the United Against Online Abuse campaign. Governments, sporting bodies, and institutions are joining hands. Today\'s forum is a pivotal step in commencing our campaign\'s pillars."\n\nThe United Against Online Abuse campaign (UAOA) is a research-led coalition aiming to tackle the growing epidemic of online abuse and hate speech in sport. Dublin City University are the major research partners of the UAOA coalition and have produced a number of research reports and the UAOA campaign are funding six postgraduate research students at DCU. This initiative is a collaborative mission between national governments, regulatory institutions, and fellow sporting bodies with the objective of building a global coalition to tackle online abuse within the sporting ecosystem.\n\nKirby Tarrant, Partner In Charge at Clark Hill, emphasised the importance of the initiative: "Online abuse in sports is not just a problem for athletes and teams, it impacts sponsors, fans, and the sports community as a whole. Clark Hill is proud to be part of the United Against Online Abuse (UAOA) coalition with the FIA.

Shirt, shorts, and socks, all in black & white zig-zag stripes.\n\n"Manchester United\'s relationship with all-over stripes goes back to the team\'s first year at its home in Old Trafford, when the team wore a classic blue-and-white striped shirt as the alternative kit. The collar on this new jersey features a \'110 years of stripes\' sign-off, signifying the history of the club\'s jerseys. "\n\nIf you run this through Google Translate from Horse Sh*t to English, you get: \'We\'ve done a kit that looks like a zebra lol.\'\n\nIt\'s been over a decade since Vincent Tan changed the Bluebirds\' home colours from blue to red, like a lunatic. The press release for this short-loved and wildly ill-advised decision included the following:\n\n"There is no getting away from the fact that history and traditions are the lifeblood of any club and as such should be jealously guarded and preserved.\n\n"Both the board and our investors fully understand and respect this and will do their utmost to uphold, protect and promote the values and virtues which the club stands for."\n\nBy changing the most fundamental aspect of the club\'s appearance and 104 years worth of tradition...\n\nMan United\'s new home kit is red. It is a red football shirt. That\'s about all there is to say about it. Or so you\'d think!\n\n"Our new 2024/25 apparel takes its inspiration from a kit worn by the Busby Babes in the early 1950s that was made from reflective materials.\n\n"The reason for those reflective materials? To aid visibility on the pitch in the early years of evening games being played under floodlights."\n\nUnless they\'re planning on getting dimmer switches on the floodlights at Old Trafford, we reckon they could\'ve just made the kits out of regular materials, as opposed to mirror fibres or whatever the f*ck.\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name the sponsors for these 20 memorable Premier League kits?\n\nBedale\'s whole schtick is being the team with the weird kits. They have been since 2017. In 2022-23, they went for a particularly fetching toad in-the-hole theme, with a mixed veg goalkeeper kit.\n\n"We\'ve gone a bit more traditional this year-last year\'s was very hard hitting and got the prostate cancer message across, but it did cause some problems playing when the temperature rose\n\n"Taking the classic Toad in the Hole and giving it a whole new meaning...and name! Welcome Bedale AFC\'s latest sausage-themed football strip: Toad in the Goal".\n\nListen, they raise awareness for charity. More power to them.\n\nYou can rely on Kappa for a really nice football kit, usually. This one might be the exception that proves the rule...\n\nFor some reason, Palencia, who were about to battle for promotion to the Spanish third tier via the playoffs in 2015-16, decided to bring out this ultra-harrowing skin suit situation specially for those games.\n\nThe tweets that went out announcing the kit\'s release were accompanied with the hashtag #Nosdejamoslapiel. Which translates as \'we give our skin\'.\n\nTo be fair, they got promoted, so maybe they were onto something. We wouldn\'t want to play against a team of living night terrors. Unfortunately, the club disbanded in 2018, just seven years after being founded.\n\nLast season\'s Arsenal away kit was one of the worst we\'ve ever seen. It absolutely stank. And that\'s odd, because Arsenal and Adidas have rarely missed when it comes to designing kits in the past. Here\'s what the press release had to say about the day-glo vomslick.\n\n"The striking shirt is adorned with fluid black lines that take inspiration from the map of Islington. The intricate design symbolizes the trips that fans embark on when they leave their home borough to support the team away from home."\n\nHonestly just fed up with silly little affectations used as marketing ploys.\n\n"The contrasting strips feature sound wave graphics that pay tribute to the chants around the National Football Stadium at Windsor Park on matchdays, while the crew neckline and short sleeves keep it classic."\n\nF*cking soundwaves. Matter of time till players have their own distinctive QR codes printed onto their shirts, which are scanned by the cameras, causing their own personal goal music to play through the tannoy when they score.\n\nPuma saw fit to design a cookie-cutter template for Manchester City\'s 2021-22 third kit, the likes of which might set you back €5 at a beachside market stall in Fuerteventura.\n\n"The bold new progressive jersey takes traditional design and rewrites the rules to push the boundaries of football kit design."\n\nThe press release lied. They even chucked in a quote from a player for good measure.\n\n"I wanted something different, and we definitely got that, I really like the design because the badge may change over time, but the name will live on forever"\n\nThat\'s a quote from then-City skipper Fernandinho about the kit which was exactly the same as Puma\'s template design for PSV, Fenerbahce, Marseille, Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Borussia Monchengladbach, Valencia, Stade Rennais, Shakhtar Donetsk, and Krasnodar.', 'source': {'uri': 'planetfootball.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Planet Football'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'andrew_martin@planetfootball.com', 'name': 'Andrew Martin', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd3nfwcxd527z59.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F12%2F07095217%2FJuan-Mata-Marcus-Rashford-Manchester-United.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 458902322, 'relevance': 76}

"This is because the impact of any disruption would be significantly magnified."\n\nThe paper outlines the varied cyber risk that face the Games, including cyber espionage, "Disruptive and destructive" attacks, and financially motivated hacks.\n\nAs an international event attended by government officials and heads of state, Collier believes that Russian hackers will attempt to use the event for "information gathering" on foreign, senior decision makers.\n\nHowever, attendees should also be wary, and such large events present ripe opportunities for cybercriminals of all stripes to target tourists with ticket scams and attempt to steal personal data.\n\nFor Collier, the worst case scenario would be a widescale "destructive" attack, such as the deployment of "wiper malware" which erases data on target networks, and which would throw the Paris Games into disarray.\n\nCollier argued that a coincidence of factors make these Olympics particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee banned Russia from competition in February 2022, as an immediate response to the country\'s invasion of Ukraine which the organization deemed a "blatant violation" of the Olympic Charter. Russian and Belarusian athletes still may compete under a neutral flag.\n\nAccording to Collier, this provides Putin with a "clear motivation" to target the Games and, alongside its sophisticated cyber espionage capabilities and track record of targeting previous Olympics, make it the greatest risk to the competition.\n\nDuring the 2016, 2018 and 2020 Games, state-sponsored Russian hackers leaked athlete data, disrupted networks during the opening ceremonies, and conducted reconnaissance of Olympic officials, according to Mandiant.\n\nFrance\'s ardent support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion also makes these games the perfect target for geopolitically motivated attacks, according to Collier, and France the most likely target for cyberattacks.\n\nHowever, Collier said that the reaction to the report has been encouraging since it was first published in June.\n\n"We have been really encouraged by the number of organizations involved in the Olympics that have read our report and are looking to respond to the threats that matter most to them," Collier said.

It dawns on me that the needs of the GM might not always match those of the head coach.\n\nPlaying time and opportunities for evaluation in preseason games are discussed quite a bit. How specifically those opportunities are outlined and planned I can\'t really say. But I don\'t see it as any disconnect between GM and head coach. In the preseason, players are viewed as either preparing for the regular season or fighting for depth/roster spots. Personnel and coaching have similar goals in mind.\n\nChris from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\nI really liked Mike\'s answer about the three-technique, five-technique question. It was quite informative. As a follow up, why is it called "technique" if it\'s more about the location that the guys line up in? Thanks for always teaching us!\n\nI don\'t know where "technique" came from as it applies to alignment. But that\'s the common term.\n\nTim from Olathe, KS\n\nInsiders, sometimes when the offense comes to the line of scrimmage, it appears the center is talking to his teammates. What is he talking about? Is he interfering with the QB\'s cadence or audibles?\n\nNo, he\'s usually declaring to his teammates who the "mike," or middle linebacker, is based on the defensive alignment, because the offense\'s protection call is based on identifying the "mike" and counting out each way from the middle.\n\nWesley from Woodbury, MN\n\nGood morning II, when the offense makes a substitution, the refs will hold up the snap until the defense has time to make a substitution. Is there a time limit the defense has to make this substitution or can they "drag their feet" to run down the play clock? Thanks for all of your insights!\n\nThe substitution has to be immediate, with the player(s) running on/off the field right away. If there\'s any delay, the official can simply step back and let the offense run the play.\n\nRobert from Corpus Christi, TX\n\nWhy don\'t NFL teams have summer practices at Wisconsin universities anymore?\n\nIt was quite the run, wasn\'t it? Bears in my hometown of Platteville from 1984-2000, Saints in La Crosse from 1988-99, Chiefs in River Falls from 1991-2009, and the Jaguars had their inaugural camp in Stevens Point in 1995. They all left for various reasons - staying closer to home, less overall expense, easier for their own fans to attend, local economic impact, etc. - and as teams improved their own facilities over the years, they became better equipped to deal with the heat (the main reason the Saints and Chiefs wanted to train further north all those years, though the Jaguars escaped nothing with that scorching \'95 Midwest heat wave and never came back), plus the amenities of their home facilities became more difficult to replicate elsewhere. But the Cheese League will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nDave from Gwinn, MI\n\nI tried googling this but Google is dumber than a box of wet sweat socks. Donald Driver was a great seventh-round pick (would\'ve also been a great first-round pick), but was he the greatest seventh-round pick in GB history? Who were some other notable seventh-round steals?\n\nSince the draft was reduced to seven rounds in \'94, the selection of Driver in \'99 was the best seventh-round pick by the Packers. The next five on my list would be (in chronological order) Adam Timmerman in \'95, Mark Tauscher in 2000, Scott Wells in \'04, Matt Flynn in \'08, and Rasheed Walker in \'22.\n\nKyle from St. Charles, MO\n\nIt\'s hard to believe by this time next week they\'ll have their first practice of 2024 behind them. Feels like yesterday they were just in Santa Clara. Is there any news regarding current injuries and recovery heading into camp or will you find out more on Wednesday?\n\nWe will find out more information when we hear from Coach LaFleur and/or when we see the first practice. Even though rookies are reporting a few days early, there\'s no media access this week.\n\nMonty from Velva, ND\n\nWith the switch from a 3-4 to a 4-3, it got me wondering about the transition for OLB to DE and vice versa. I remember Aaron Kampman struggling with the change to OLB. Do you think it is easier to change from OLB to DE or DE to OLB?\n\nI would guess the former. Outside \'backers in a 3-4 have pass coverage responsibilities that D-ends in a 4-3 generally don\'t. So while one transition adds to a player\'s plate, the other subtracts from it.\n\nBob from Covington, KY\n\nRewatched last year\'s 49ers game on the NFL Network yesterday. Joe Barry\'s defense held the Niners to 24 points and if the Packers hadn\'t missed a couple hundred tackles, it might have been 14. I\'m looking forward to a more aggressive defense this season but it still comes down to execution. Seems to me the scheme isn\'t nearly as important as the guys doing their jobs. It\'ll be interesting, and hopefully fun, to watch what develops.\n\nIt\'s always first and foremost about the players. Scheme and coaching can help get the most out of them, but the players are the ones who must get the job done. As for the Niners game, holding them to 17 points in the first 54 minutes was commendable. Allowing a 5-minute, 69-yard TD drive at crunch time - during which the only third downs were third-and-1, third-and-5, and third-and-1 - was not.\n\nUnder Matt LaFleur? 3-2. Under Mike McCarthy it was 9-4, Mike Sherman 3-3, Ray Rhodes 1-0 and Mike Holmgren 5-2. That\'s 21-11 dating back to 1992.\n\nThere are several candidates. Quay Walker, Devonte Wyatt and Lukas Van Ness seem the most likely suspects to me.\n\nMichael from Baraboo, WI\n\nWhat are the biggest final roster battles that we can look forward to watching this summer?\n\nIn no particular order: RG, CB2, QB2, RB2, WR5-6, and K are the most noteworthy in my book.\n\nClipton from Pasadena, CA\n\nMike, not sure if you\'re still accepting dead zone questions ... Crappies: worms, minnows, or jigs?\n\nMike, not sure how many Brewer games you made but your chance of seeing a win was slim. If ever a team needed a break it\'s the Crew. Hopefully the reports are correct about some pitchers returning soon.\n\nThat would be nice. I went to four games last week and saw only one win, but the law of averages was bound to catch up with me. I was 5-0 previously this year and therefore finished my spring/summer 6-3.\n\nCraig from Sussex, WI\n\nWhat is Spoff\'s favorite baseball book? Mine is "Babe" by Robert Creamer.\n\nIt\'s hard to narrow down the list, but "Moneyball," "Eight Men Out," "Game of Shadows," and "One Shot At Forever" all rank up there for me.\n\nDavid from Vicksburg, MI\n\nHow long will it take to put in the new defense and get everyone playing on the same page?\n\nTo repurpose one of Vic\'s favorite Chuck Noll quotes: Nobody knows.\n\nBob from Emmaus, PA\n\nI believe that the Packers have added talent that will have immediate impact to a good team and made positive changes to the coaching and training staff. When should we start getting excited about the upcoming season?\n\nWhenever you want, but be cognizant the baloney doesn\'t officially stop until the ball is on the tee in Brazil. Or take a quick listen to Mark.\n\nMark from Westminster, CO\n\nAs we near Packers training camp, I\'m always reminded of Allen Iverson\'s practice rant. "We sitting in here - I\'m supposed to be the franchise player, and we in here talking about practice. I mean, listen: We talking about practice. Not a game. Not a game. Not a game. We talking about practice. Not a game. Not the game that I go out there and die for and play every game like it\'s my last. Not the game. We talking about practice, man." Still a classic to this day.\n\nJoin Packers.com writers as they answer the fans\' questions in Insider Inbox', 'source': {'uri': 'industriesnews.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'industriesnews.net'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/pkr1721203929.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 458902028, 'relevance': 32}

Investigating the area kicks off Lost In Madness, a low-level quest that sends players on a cross-island scavenger hunt using a Cultist's Treasure Map.\n\nLost In Madness is pretty confusing compared to other quests or exploration tasks in Once Human. The lack of quest markers is an issue, and while there's a map provided for players as part of the quest, it's not very helpful either. Here's a complete guide on everything you need to do for the Lost In Madness quest.\n\nHow To Start The Lost In Madness Quest In Once Human\n\nClose\n\nTo begin this side quest, the first thing you have to do is visit a small grocery store called BNMart in the Coastside Plaza area in the eastern end of the Dayton Wetlands region. Interact with the red candle in the corner of the store, and your vision will warp for a moment. Then, a chest will appear in front of you. Loot it, and you'll find the Cultist's Treasure map, which is needed for the rest of the side quest.\n\nCultist's Treasure Map Location\n\nClose\n\nIf you view the Cultist's Treasure Map in your inventory, you'll find that the drawing there isn't very helpful. However, the quest will point you to Chalk Peak, a level 32 region west of the Dayton Wetlands. It's going to be a long trip going to Chalk Peak, so you may want to consider building a car in Once Human so you can have a smoother time driving.\n\nThe location you're looking for is the Believer Colony, which is directly west of Tall Grass Inn. It's a small Vulture camp along the road with three buildings in it. Once you get here, clear the camp and look for the aptly-named Cultist's Treasure Chest. The location of this chest may change from one player to another, but for us, we found it on the second floor west-most one.\n\nThe contents of this chest may also differ from player to player. Opening it yields some account and battle pass EXP, 100 Energy Links, Stellar Planula, and a level 1 Eclipse Cortex. The latter is particularly interesting -- it's one of the main ways of getting Starchrom in Once Human. Starchrom is the main currency used for making wishes and buying blueprints in Wish Machines.\n\nOnce Human\n\nSystem PC , Mobile , Google , Apple\n\nPlatform(s) PC , Android , iOS\n\nReleased July 9, 2024\n\nPublisher(s) Starry Studio , NetEase, Inc.\n\nGenre(s) Survival , Shooter , Open-World", 'source': {'uri': 'gamerant.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Game Rant'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'marc_santos@gamerant.com', 'name': 'Marc Santos', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240717135445_1.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.3490196078431372, 'wgt': 458901946, 'relevance': 6}

However, a fact-check by India TV has revealed that this claim is completely false.\n\nIn the recently concluded by-polls, the INDIA bloc triumphed by winning 10 out of 13 assembly constituencies across seven states, significantly outperforming the BJP, which secured only two seats.\n\nA video is circulating on social media in which PM Modi is heard congratulating Team India. This video is being shared with the claim that PM Modi is overjoyed after the impressive performance of the INDIA alliance in the recent by-elections held for 13 assembly seats in seven states. The caption of the viral video states, "In the by-elections of 7 states, the INDIA alliance has got a big victory; Narendra Modi ji is overjoyed with this victory."\n\nAs this video was rapidly going viral on social media, with claims it was related to the Indi alliance\'s victory in the assembly by-elections, we decided to investigate. First, we used Google Open Search with relevant keywords to check the video\'s context. During our search, we found the same video on PM Modi\'s \'X\' handle. The video was uploaded on the night of June 29 with the caption, "Champions! Our team brings the T20 World Cup home in style! We are proud of the Indian cricket team. This match was historic." The video actually showed PM Modi celebrating the Indian cricket team\'s victory in the T20 World Cup final.\n\nThe fact check by India TV has revealed that the viral video on social media is neither related to the assembly by-election nor connected to the victory of the Indi alliance. A segment of the video celebrating Team India\'s victory in the T20 World Cup was edited and shared with a false claim.

They\'re a combination of family, life and fun.\n\nSo if you\'re looking for a fun night out with the family, his show "Flashes of Magic" is just the right fit.\n\nThe entertainer who has worked with David Blaine and appeared on "Fool Us" with Penn & Teller will be in town at The Pines Theater Friday night.\n\n"It\'s a brand new show that\'s been out since June," Mirz said during a phone interview while he was on his way to Alabama Tuesday afternoon. "It\'s a family-friendly show. If anyone has seen anything on me or my previous work, this is a completely new show."\n\nLast year\'s show was titled "Ticket for One." The show coming to Lufkin, "Flashes of Magic," has a different story behind it.\n\n"My first special was a magic show, but it was also a love letter to my father," Mirz said. "Now my daughter just turned 2 last week. This is going to be a magic show and it\'s going to be interactive. It\'s a reminder to everyone that the greatest magic trick you can give yourself is showing the world through the lens of a child."\n\nMirz said his ties to magic go back several years. He is a first-generation American with his parents immigrating from Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nHe tragically lost his father, who was killed when Mirz was just a year old.\n\nOnce he was told of how his father died -- Mirz was approximately 8 at the time -- magic became an outlet for Mirz.\n\n"A lot of my magic is through stories," Mirz said. "I talk about the seasons of losing my father. He\'s my hero. He was a hero that night. He got killed saving so many lives.\n\n"I got into magic shortly after my mom told me what had happened to my dad. I was 8 or 9, and at the time I was embarrassed and sad. I wanted to keep it a secret so I ran to magic. There was the time when I saw the David Blaine special. I thought that\'s what I want to do for the rest of my life. David Blaine really had a big influence on me."\n\nHe said his official introduction to magic wasn\'t any kind of glamorous tale.\n\n"We couldn\'t Google back then," Mirz said. "It was my uncle looking through the yellow pages. They took me to a magic shop, which I think was in Dallas. It just said \'magic shop\' on the front. He took me there, I got a few things and it just went on and on. It\'s been a fun journey."\n\nHe admits the journey of being a magician isn\'t for everyone. He described that path along with the advice he would give to one of the ones he loves most.\n\n"I\'ve done it pretty much my whole life," Mirz said. "I graduated, packed my bags and hit the road. My life has been a little bit of a carnival. I wanted to start at a young age. I knew the more times I failed, the better I\'d be, so I started touring right out of high school. I certainly wouldn\'t wish this on my daughter.

Except we now know that that Enid Blyton chumminess hid a far-from-storybook reality. The Famous Three, it turns out, was an optical illusion.\n\nWith the Olympics set to roll around again next week -- bonjour Paree and the first games powered on the back of the baguette -- those old Kate and Harry photos make for a melancholy jaunt down memory lane.\n\nThey perfectly capture how much has been lost and how much the reality differed from superficial appearances. They\'re a reminder of how in-the-dark the world was about what was really going on with Harry.\n\nBut back then in 2012, when blissful ignorance reigned, the royal stocks looked like a buy, buy, buy! The future seemed blindingly bright with the younger generation of Crown Inc coming across as a very clean-behind-the-ears, united, one-for-all pep squad.\n\nWhen, five years later, Harry added fiancé Meghan Markle (now, of course, the Duchess of Sussex) to their pally group, we were officially in a Buckingham Palace bull market. The better quarters of Fleet Street and the public positively mooned over the new couple and the prevailing consensus was simple- these glam, cool kids full of verve and belief in the monarchical mission might save the dog and pony show yet.\n\nTogether, William, Kate, Harry and Meghan, were a dynamite proposition.\n\nNo one knew it then but that was to be the high water mark.\n\nWithin two years, that \'dynamite\' would go kaboom and the royal family would never quite be the same again.\n\nHowever, in 2012, to all appearances Harry and Kate seemed to have a delightfully matey thing going on. It used to be that a reliable cheerer upper was Googling photos of the duo having a giggle together -- at the Olympics, on the Buckingham Palace balcony, at a palace tea party, at a lunch to celebrate the late Queen\'s 90th birthday, at a BAFTA event, church services, a wedding, at Trooping the Colour, at Trooping the Colour again, another Trooping, during a trip to Belgium, at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nHarry and Kate\'s lives were intertwined professionally too. They shared an office at Kensington Palace and theirs was the unwieldily named Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. With a certain clockwork predictability the three would be posted off to engagements like a bargain pack of HRHs, a sort of \'buy two, get one free\' arrangement.\n\nAppearances though are shifty, truck things.\n\nHarry\'s time as a "third wheel", as he put it to ITV\'s Tom Bradby last year, "was fun at times but also, I guess slightly awkward at times as well."\n\nAs another Londoner, Oscar Wilde, put it, "the truth is rarely pure and never simple."\n\nIn Spare, Harry does not just offer up something of a biting portrayal of his father and brother but an unfavourable one of Kate too, detailing the distance that existed in their private lives.\n\nHe writes that after his brother and sister-in-law had wed in 2011, "they became a Household, and as such were entitled to more staff, more cars, bigger home, grander office, extra resources, engraved letterheads. I didn\'t care about such perks, but I did care about respect. As a confirmed bachelor I was an outsider, a nonperson within my own family."\n\nWhen in 2013, the year after these Olympics shots were taken, William and Kate were undertaking extensive renovations of their Kensington Palace apartment, and with Harry living "just across the way", he writes that he had imagined popping around "holding a bottle of wine and an armful of kiddie presents."\n\nInstead, "it didn\'t work out that way...I assumed they\'d have me over any minute now. Any day. But day after day it didn\'t happen."\n\nFor all those public giggles between Harry and Kate, those imagined cosy suppers, all Shepherds\' pies and easy, warm family life, they never materialised. It was a magic faraway tree of a domestic idyll.\n\nAdded to which, all the while, Harry was suffering deeply. We now know that his cheeky persona hid incredibly deep psychic pain and trauma from his mother\'s death.\n\nSo, I can\'t be the only one who, looking at those 2012 shots, keeps hearing the words \'if only\' rattling through my head on a loop. If only William and Kate had somehow realised what Harry was going through; if only he had made it plain; if only feelings and resentments hadn\'t been left to ferment and to churn.\n\nWhen the late Queen entered the Olympic arena on that July 27 to awestruck applause and a UK enjoying a giddy high and a prolonged beer buzz, the future of the monarchy looked safe as (palatial) houses.\n\nInstead, those Harry and Kate 2012 photos are portentous - of how soon things would fracture and fall apart and how falteringly and shaky, a decade on in 2022, Crown Inc would be looking.\n\nWhat these resurfaced photos of Harry and Kate represent are not just the ghosts of royal history past but the ghosts of what might have been too.\n\nDaniela Elser is a writer, editor and a royal commentator with more than 15 years\' experience working with a number of Australia\'s leading media titles.\n\nOriginally published as Pictures resurface of Harry, Kate and William as painful reminder of what was', 'source': {'uri': 'couriermail.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Courier Mail'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'daniela_elser@couriermail.com.au', 'name': 'Daniela Elser', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/81e4fd1c6b0ccd352960a55f1b809889', 'eventUri': 'eng-9733305', 'sentiment': 0.3568627450980393, 'wgt': 458889550, 'relevance': 29}

Avalon\'s Katie Scanlon and Becca Cubbler followed with a victory in the swim relay. Ocean City\'s Lexi Santer and Brynn Gallagher were first in the paddle relay, but Avalon clinched first place early when Maggie Murphy and Cubbler won the run-swim relay. Ocean City\'s Claudia Booth, Chloe Care, Morgan Decosta and Santer made it a closer final score by winning the surf dash.\n\nAvalon scored 15 points with three wins. Ocean City finished second with 13 points. Longport placed second in two races and totaled eight points for third. Cape May was fourth with seven points, and Margate was fifth with six. Sea Girt (the defending team champion) and Sea Isle City also scored six points, but Margate finished higher in the surf dash, the event\'s tiebreaker.\n\nPeople are also reading...

"The ocean was wild. You saw that right from the warmups, and credit our girls, they\'ve been working really hard, and they got out there and competed well tonight. They won three events, last night the Countys (a men\'s and women\'s event won by Avalon) and hopefully the Kerrs (Avalon\'s home event) on Friday, they really highlight the depth of our beach patrol. We\'ve got a lot of really talented lifeguards on every single lifeguard stand."\n\nThe McDonnell sisters rowed to the flag a quarter-mile out, and Molly jumped out and swam to the finish line on the beach.\n\n"It was quite rough. For most of the row we weren\'t first," said Molly McDonnell, 19, a Haddonfield resident and rising sophomore rower at Georgetown University. "But my sister (a former Stanford University rower) and I are like second-half of the race-type people. So we knew at the flag we would probably get them. The water was really, really rough, but it feels good to come out on top."\n\nScanlon got the lead and Cubbler kept it in the swim relay, which had a 300-meter course. Scanlon, 17, is a rising senior at Mount St. Joseph Academy in Pennsylvania. Cubbler, 26, is a former Bloomsburg University swimmer.\n\n"When I went around the second buoy (the turn for home), I just sprinted as hard as I could and tried to catch some waves," Scanlon said. "I was leading. I had a lot of confidence in Becca. I was excited to see her (leading) at the last flag."\n\nCubbler said her only thought was to hold onto the lead.\n\nSanter went first and Gallagher anchored for the O.C. win in the box paddle relay. Gallagher, 16, is a rising senior swimmer and surfer at Ocean City High School. She caught a good wave near the beach.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"The waves were pretty crazy with the wind right now," Gallagher said. "So I knew that if I just stay calm and got a wave in and really pushed on that last run to that finish line, that everything would work out, and it did.\n\n"Lexi\'s awesome. She really pushes all of us girls on the beach patrol. She\'s a really great role model for us younger girls."\n\nMurphy ran a half-mile on the beach and Cubbler swam in Avalon\'s run-swim win. It was Cubbler\'s second victory of the evening.\n\nThe winner of the run leg was Margate\'s Sofia Day, a 17-year-old rising senior at Mainland Regional.\n\nSanter anchored the surf dash win, her third event of the day and second victory.\n\n"I love the surf dash," Santer said. "The Ocean City race is pretty cool in that you get to do a lot of the team relays. The surf dash is always four persons, and we have a really strong group, and I kind of know the three girls before me are always going to put me in a good place."\n\nResults\n\nRow-swim relay: 1.

They\'re a combination of family, life and fun.\n\nSo if you\'re looking for a fun night out with the family, his show "Flashes of Magic" is just the right fit.\n\nThe entertainer who has worked with David Blaine and appeared on "Fool Us" with Penn & Teller will be in town at The Pines Theater Friday night.\n\n"It\'s a brand new show that\'s been out since June," Mirz said during a phone interview while he was on his way to Alabama Tuesday afternoon. "It\'s a family-friendly show. If anyone has seen anything on me or my previous work, this is a completely new show."\n\nLast year\'s show was titled "Ticket for One." The show coming to Lufkin, "Flashes of Magic," has a different story behind it.\n\n"My first special was a magic show, but it was also a love letter to my father," Mirz said. "Now my daughter just turned 2 last week. This is going to be a magic show and it\'s going to be interactive. It\'s a reminder to everyone that the greatest magic trick you can give yourself is showing the world through the lens of a child."\n\nMirz said his ties to magic go back several years. He is a first-generation American with his parents immigrating from Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nHe tragically lost his father, who was killed when Mirz was just a year old.\n\nOnce he was told of how his father died -- Mirz was approximately 8 at the time -- magic became an outlet for Mirz.\n\n"A lot of my magic is through stories," Mirz said. "I talk about the seasons of losing my father. He\'s my hero. He was a hero that night. He got killed saving so many lives.\n\n"I got into magic shortly after my mom told me what had happened to my dad. I was 8 or 9, and at the time I was embarrassed and sad. I wanted to keep it a secret so I ran to magic. There was the time when I saw the David Blaine special. I thought that\'s what I want to do for the rest of my life. David Blaine really had a big influence on me."\n\nHe said his official introduction to magic wasn\'t any kind of glamorous tale.\n\n"We couldn\'t Google back then," Mirz said. "It was my uncle looking through the yellow pages. They took me to a magic shop, which I think was in Dallas. It just said \'magic shop\' on the front. He took me there, I got a few things and it just went on and on. It\'s been a fun journey."\n\nHe admits the journey of being a magician isn\'t for everyone. He described that path along with the advice he would give to one of the ones he loves most.\n\n"I\'ve done it pretty much my whole life," Mirz said. "I graduated, packed my bags and hit the road. My life has been a little bit of a carnival. I wanted to start at a young age. I knew the more times I failed, the better I\'d be, so I started touring right out of high school. I certainly wouldn\'t wish this on my daughter. Hopefully I can encourage her to take another path."\n\nThat journey has taken him to different parts of the world.\n\nHe estimates he does approximately 120 shows a year. He has been on two tours to Europe and guesses he has performed in each state with the exception of possibly Maine and Alaska.\n\nIn the process, he has met up with some of the country\'s most recognizable names.\n\nHe was on the show "Fool Us," with Penn & Teller, two world-famous musicians.\n\n"I was on their TV show a couple of years ago," Mirz said.

I live in SF, where it\'s a social death sentence to voice support for Trump. Regardless, I will be voting for Trump..."\n\nThe report said trending on Google are searches for "MAGA hat, "Trump shirt" and more.\n\nEven "Trump yard sign" and "donate to Trump."\n\nOther social media comments, "I\'d like to put a Trump sign in my yard but I\'m too scared to be harassed or threatened. This is where we are at as a nation and it\'s disgusting."\n\n"Trump yard sign goes into my yard on Monday.\n\nThe report noted, "The takeaway here is that either a whole bunch of Trump supporters loaded up on new MAGA gear or closet Trump supporters are coming out of the shadows to represent the former president."\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The tournament\'s top three flights -- the championship flight, first flight and senior championship -- were all won by El Paso residents, and all three were repeat winners.\n\n"There are a lot of good golfers in El Paso," Branden said. "It goes underrated in the area."\n\nThe championship matchup lived up to the billing. Neither side led by more than one hole, and the match was tied for most of its duration.\n\nThe Bargers took advantage first with a birdie on hole 3, but soon after the Mounces responded. The Bargers bogeyed hole 6 then the Mounces birdied the seventh to take the lead. An immediate Barger response with a birdie on hole 8 soon led to a tie with nine holes to play, both teams out at 31, 5-under.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their selected drive went in the right rough, and neither could find the green on approach out of there. Poor chip shots led to a 25-foot par putt to save the hole, but Steve converted it from long range.\n\nMore concern emerged on the par-3 17th after TJ missed a heavy-breaking 5-footer for par, but, again, Steve came through once again to save the hole, keeping things tied heading into hole 18.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"Steve made a lot of putts," Michael said. "It felt like he wasn\'t missing."\n\nBoth teams had mid-range birdie looks for the win on 18, but the Mounces came up just short. After watching his dad come through to create an opportunity, TJ saw a moment. He fired the putt from just on the front of the green, and it tracked toward the hole with plenty of pace. Right as it approached, it lipped around the hole\'s rim and out -- no good.\n\n"It caught a lot of the hole, it was a really good putt," Branden said. "It looked right down the middle."\n\nIn the playoff, starting back at hole 1, both teams found the fairway, but the Mounces had the early advantage with Branden\'s drive being a 340-yard missile. Their wedge approach stuck to about seven feet while the Bargers were in 20-foot range.\n\nNeither Barger could convert, but the outcome wasn\'t set when Branden missed the birdie putt. However, Michael rolled it in on a perfect line, securing the title. The Mounces finished with a 62, 10-under par.\n\n"Most teams don\'t have two guys who can hit it out there quite a ways like us," Michael said.\n\n"We have a lot of shorter birdie putts because we\'re hitting wedges into the greens," Branden added.\n\nIn the senior championship, Todd Manning and Jim Mounce -- Michael and Branden\'s father -- cruised by going 5-up through nine holes and maintaining it, losing just one hole all match for a 5&4 win. In the first flight, Jason Unzicker and Kyle Tague took the lead on hole 3 and never relinquished it, securing a 2-up victory with a 67, 5-under par. Both teams won their respective divisions last year.\n\nBoth Michael and Branden plan on playing in the Bloomington-Normal Medal Play Tournament in early August. Michael is looking for a summer trifecta after winning the Bloomington-Normal Match Play Championship on June 17.\n\nFollow Will Foley on Twitter: @thewillfoley\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

New gauntlet is Sooners' best litmus test.", 'body': 'Brad Townsend, The Dallas Morning News\n\nWith all due respect to its oldest and most cutthroat rival, Oklahoma, not Texas, brings the more sterling football credentials to the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThe Sooners have won seven national titles; the Longhorns four. Oklahoma has 50 conference championships to UT\'s 33, including 14 compared to the Longhorns\' four during the schools\' 29 seasons together in the Big 12.\n\nIt\'s little wonder, then, that when asked Tuesday about his team\'s degree of readiness for its first season in the SEC, Sooners coach Brent Venables all but bowed up and clenched his jaw.\n\n"We\'re excited for the challenge," he said. "Oklahoma isn\'t intimidated as a football program. We\'re running towards the SEC."\n\nFearlessness aside, though, third-year coach Venables admittedly could not project how the Sooners\' relative Big 12 dominance would translate in the almighty SEC.\n\nWith a 10-3 record and No. 15 Associated Press finish last season, Oklahoma among Big 12 brethren was only outranked by No. 3 Texas, which by the way lost to the Sooners 34-30 in October.\n\nConversely, five SEC teams ranked higher than OU: No. 4 Georgia, No. 5 Alabama, No. 8 Missouri, No. 9 Ole Miss and No. 12 LSU. With the exception of Georgia, four of those teams are on OU\'s 2024 schedule, three of them on the road, along with the annual clash against Texas in the Cotton Bowl.\n\n"I think going through it gives you the best litmus test. There\'s nothing that you can read about or even watch on tape, to be honest with you."\n\nBy most metrics, the Oklahoma program is much better positioned to contend in the SEC than this time a year ago, when it was coming off a 6-7 season and Venables appeared to be on tenuous ground in Norman.\n\nThen came a 6-0 start, including the upset of Texas, and a climb to as No. 6 in the country before stumbles at Kansas (38-33) and Oklahoma State (27-24).\n\nOn June 21 Venables received a six-year, $51.6 million contract - a reward not only for last season\'s bounce-back but his third straight top-ten-ranked recruiting class as OU strived to build an SEC-worthy roster after announcing in July of 2021 that it intended to bolt with Texas from the Big 12.\n\n"The trenches is where this conference is decided usually year-in and year-out; incredibly challenging from that standpoint," Venables said, adding these SEC traits. "The length; the speed; the play at quarterback; the coaching acumen from top to bottom."\n\nFor quarterback play, the Sooners are turning to their latest heralded prospect at that position, sophomore Jackson Arnold, the 2022 Gatorade National Player of the Year out of Denton Guyer.\n\nWith SEC Media Days taking place in Texas for the first time, Venables noted that nearly 20 Sooners are from Dallas-Fort Worth area high schools.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nCounting returning players and portal transfers, Venables estimated that 24 Sooners are entering their third year or more as starters.\n\nSenior linebacker Danny Stutsman, out of Windermere, Fla., initially decided to enter the 2024 NFL draft after earning second-team Walter Camp All-America honors last season. His OU locker was even cleared out, but he had a change of heart after meeting with Venables.\n\n"He told me, \'Look, Oklahoma is going to win with or without you.\' " Stutsman recalled Tuesday. "I fully believe that. The program has been amazing before I got here; it\'ll be amazing when I leave here."\n\nHave Venables and his staff built enough depth in the offensive and defensive lines to compete with the SEC\'s elite teams?\n\nVenables says he believes the program has 9-to-11 offensive linemen and 10-to-12 defensive linemen who are capable of playing "winning football."\n\n"There are several guys that maybe don\'t have the depth of experience, but I trust my eyes," he said, adding, "This is a game of development."\n\nThis inaugural season, Venables said, not only will reveal how SEC-ready the Sooners are as currently constructed, but player prototypes and positional needs going forward.\n\nOklahoma of course will be learning the ways of the SEC at the same time as its fellow Big 12 co-alpha dog, Texas, except now the schools will be part of a pack of Rottweilers.\n\nA reporter on Tuesday half-jokingly started to ask Venables whether he and Texas coach Steve Sarkisian would be sharing notes.\n\n"Probably not," Venables interjected before the reporter could finish the question.\n\nWill moving to the SEC in any way affect that rivalry, which dates to 1900?\n\n"It\'s as deep-seated and hate-filled and emotional of a rivalry as there is in all of college football," Venables said. "So I don\'t see how the conference affiliation will make a big difference."\n\nTexas won the first Big 12 title, in 1996, and last season\'s, though the Sooners dominated much of what occurred between.\n\nNow both schools will face multiple near-Texas-OU-caliber conference games every season.\n\n"If you think that one is emotionally taxing, you\'re going to go into a lot of venues that the pageantry is going to be real, the stadiums are going to be completely full," Venables said. "And a lot of people are going to hate your guts for three hours or so."\n\n____\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'newsadvance.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NewsAdvance.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newsadvance.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/b4/db4bb5ff-0825-56ff-8518-6d72e0138791/66972cc7110de.image.jpg?crop=1764%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9738272', 'sentiment': 0.223529411764706, 'wgt': 458880063, 'relevance': 51}

With the exception of Georgia, four of those teams are on OU\'s 2024 schedule, three of them on the road, along with the annual clash against Texas in the Cotton Bowl.\n\n"I think going through it gives you the best litmus test. There\'s nothing that you can read about or even watch on tape, to be honest with you."\n\nBy most metrics, the Oklahoma program is much better positioned to contend in the SEC than this time a year ago, when it was coming off a 6-7 season and Venables appeared to be on tenuous ground in Norman.\n\nThen came a 6-0 start, including the upset of Texas, and a climb to as No. 6 in the country before stumbles at Kansas (38-33) and Oklahoma State (27-24).\n\nOn June 21 Venables received a six-year, $51.6 million contract - a reward not only for last season\'s bounce-back but his third straight top-ten-ranked recruiting class as OU strived to build an SEC-worthy roster after announcing in July of 2021 that it intended to bolt with Texas from the Big 12.\n\n"The trenches is where this conference is decided usually year-in and year-out; incredibly challenging from that standpoint," Venables said, adding these SEC traits. "The length; the speed; the play at quarterback; the coaching acumen from top to bottom."\n\nFor quarterback play, the Sooners are turning to their latest heralded prospect at that position, sophomore Jackson Arnold, the 2022 Gatorade National Player of the Year out of Denton Guyer.\n\nWith SEC Media Days taking place in Texas for the first time, Venables noted that nearly 20 Sooners are from Dallas-Fort Worth area high schools.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nCounting returning players and portal transfers, Venables estimated that 24 Sooners are entering their third year or more as starters.\n\nSenior linebacker Danny Stutsman, out of Windermere, Fla., initially decided to enter the 2024 NFL draft after earning second-team Walter Camp All-America honors last season. His OU locker was even cleared out, but he had a change of heart after meeting with Venables.\n\n"He told me, \'Look, Oklahoma is going to win with or without you.\' " Stutsman recalled Tuesday. "I fully believe that. The program has been amazing before I got here; it\'ll be amazing when I leave here."\n\nHave Venables and his staff built enough depth in the offensive and defensive lines to compete with the SEC\'s elite teams?\n\nVenables says he believes the program has 9-to-11 offensive linemen and 10-to-12 defensive linemen who are capable of playing "winning football."\n\n"There are several guys that maybe don\'t have the depth of experience, but I trust my eyes," he said, adding, "This is a game of development."\n\nThis inaugural season, Venables said, not only will reveal how SEC-ready the Sooners are as currently constructed, but player prototypes and positional needs going forward.\n\nOklahoma of course will be learning the ways of the SEC at the same time as its fellow Big 12 co-alpha dog, Texas, except now the schools will be part of a pack of Rottweilers.\n\nA reporter on Tuesday half-jokingly started to ask Venables whether he and Texas coach Steve Sarkisian would be sharing notes.\n\n"Probably not," Venables interjected before the reporter could finish the question.\n\nWill moving to the SEC in any way affect that rivalry, which dates to 1900?\n\n"It\'s as deep-seated and hate-filled and emotional of a rivalry as there is in all of college football," Venables said. "So I don\'t see how the conference affiliation will make a big difference."\n\nTexas won the first Big 12 title, in 1996, and last season\'s, though the Sooners dominated much of what occurred between.\n\nNow both schools will face multiple near-Texas-OU-caliber conference games every season.\n\n"If you think that one is emotionally taxing, you\'re going to go into a lot of venues that the pageantry is going to be real, the stadiums are going to be completely full," Venables said. "And a lot of people are going to hate your guts for three hours or so."\n\n____\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'heraldcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HeraldCourier.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/ff/fffaa8f9-c7b6-5177-8ff2-891732098267/66972a5643dbd.image.jpg?crop=1764%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9738272', 'sentiment': 0.3647058823529412, 'wgt': 458879914, 'relevance': 26}

He finished his head coaching career with a .596 winning percentage, just shy of the Hall of Fame\'s .600 standard.

"But I also understand that Coach Leach would be a great value to the Hall of Fame because of the legacy that he has, because of the impact that he made, because of the innovator that he was, because of the legacy of coaches that he left. In my opinion, not only a winner but a Hall of Famer."\n\nLeach coached college football for 35 years, spending the 21st century as head coach of Texas Tech, Washington State and Mississippi State. He pioneered the Air Raid offense and is credited with popularizing the scheme, now widely used at every level of the sport. His coaching tree is extensive, including big names like Baylor\'s Dave Aranda, TCU\'s Sonny Dykes, USC\'s Lincoln Riley, the Arizona Cardinals\' Kliff Kingsbury and Tennessee\'s Josh Heupel.\n\n"Coach Leach, in my mind, and I believe in most of the people in this room\'s mind, is a no-doubt Hall of Famer. He impacted our game more in the last 50 years than a lot of other people, not only with his legacy, but also with his football acumen," Drinkwitz said. "His Air Raid offense is the dominant offense when you look at high school football, its elements in college football, and all the way translating into the NFL. We all know Y-cross, we all know that six is four verticals. We all understand that rocket laser where tailback screens rocket to the right, laser to the left."\n\nFor coaches under 70 years old -- Leach was 61 when he passed -- three years must have passed since the end of their career before they can be nominated for the Hall of Fame by their schools. Texas Tech and Washington State have already said they will try to nominate Leach, according to The Athletic, meaning the ball is in the NFF\'s court as to whether they allow him on the ballot.\n\nWhile the organization hasn\'t made any definitive statements on Leach\'s eligibility, representatives from the NFF have defended their standards. Still, Drinkwitz called the decision "obvious."\n\n"I hope that Mr. Hatchell will recognize this. As the CEO, he has the ability to utilize his discretion to make the obvious into reality," Drinkwitz said. "That obvious is that the Hall of Fame is incomplete without Coach Mike Leach in it."\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'heraldcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HeraldCourier.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/eb/7ebe5839-6a97-5635-aa4b-1d17a6d3f92a/66971c5b85433.image.jpg?crop=1528%2C802%2C0%2C277&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9738670', 'sentiment': 0.3176470588235294, 'wgt': 458875687, 'relevance': 51}

They\'re a combination of family, life and fun.\n\nSo if you\'re looking for a fun night out with the family, his show "Flashes of Magic" is just the right fit.\n\nThe entertainer who has worked with David Blaine and appeared on "Fool Us" with Penn & Teller will be in town at The Pines Theater Friday night.\n\n"It\'s a brand new show that\'s been out since June," Mirz said during a phone interview while he was on his way to Alabama Tuesday afternoon. "It\'s a family-friendly show. If anyone has seen anything on me or my previous work, this is a completely new show."\n\nLast year\'s show was titled "Ticket for One." The show coming to Lufkin, "Flashes of Magic," has a different story behind it.\n\n"My first special was a magic show, but it was also a love letter to my father," Mirz said. "Now my daughter just turned 2 last week. This is going to be a magic show and it\'s going to be interactive. It\'s a reminder to everyone that the greatest magic trick you can give yourself is showing the world through the lens of a child."\n\nMirz said his ties to magic go back several years. He is a first-generation American with his parents immigrating from Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nHe tragically lost his father, who was killed when Mirz was just a year old.\n\nOnce he was told of how his father died -- Mirz was approximately 8 at the time -- magic became an outlet for Mirz.\n\n"A lot of my magic is through stories," Mirz said. "I talk about the seasons of losing my father. He\'s my hero. He was a hero that night. He got killed saving so many lives.\n\n"I got into magic shortly after my mom told me what had happened to my dad. I was 8 or 9, and at the time I was embarrassed and sad. I wanted to keep it a secret so I ran to magic. There was the time when I saw the David Blaine special. I thought that\'s what I want to do for the rest of my life. David Blaine really had a big influence on me."\n\nHe said his official introduction to magic wasn\'t any kind of glamorous tale.\n\n"We couldn\'t Google back then," Mirz said. "It was my uncle looking through the yellow pages. They took me to a magic shop, which I think was in Dallas. It just said \'magic shop\' on the front. He took me there, I got a few things and it just went on and on. It\'s been a fun journey."\n\nHe admits the journey of being a magician isn\'t for everyone. He described that path along with the advice he would give to one of the ones he loves most.\n\n"I\'ve done it pretty much my whole life," Mirz said. "I graduated, packed my bags and hit the road. My life has been a little bit of a carnival. I wanted to start at a young age. I knew the more times I failed, the better I\'d be, so I started touring right out of high school. I certainly wouldn\'t wish this on my daughter. Hopefully I can encourage her to take another path."\n\nThat journey has taken him to different parts of the world.\n\nHe estimates he does approximately 120 shows a year. He has been on two tours to Europe and guesses he has performed in each state with the exception of possibly Maine and Alaska.\n\nIn the process, he has met up with some of the country\'s most recognizable names.\n\nHe was on the show "Fool Us," with Penn & Teller, two world-famous musicians.\n\n"I was on their TV show a couple of years ago," Mirz said. "The idea is a magician goes on the stage, and Penn & Teller, who are two of the greatest minds in magic, try to deconstruct the trick and tell you what you\'ve done. Very few magicians succeed. I was lucky enough to fool Penn & Teller. About a month ago, I flew back to Vegas and closed their show with that trick."\n\nIn addition, he was able to work for David Blaine on his show "The Magic Way."\n\n"It\'s amazing," Mirz said. "Magic is one of the few places you get to work with your heroes. He had a TV special \'The Magic Way\' back in 2020 on ABC. Everything was shut down during COVID and they asked if he could make a special. I got to work with him on one of the effects on the show."\n\nNow that journey is taking him to Lufkin Friday night. Despite living in Dallas, he said he doesn\'t remember staying in Lufkin but is excited to perform in town.\n\nHe gave the local audience a preview of what they can expect.\n\n"It\'s a family friendly show," Mirz said. "We\'re going to have a lot of people come on stage. That\'s part of almost every routine, bringing a mom or a dad, a brother or a sister, onto the stage and watching the rest of the family recording it. It\'s highly interactive.\n\n"It\'s amazing. You see standups all the time and they have their routine where it\'s just them. I always say their job is harder than mine. What I think makes my show so entertaining is who we bring on the stage. We try to bring big personalities up there."\n\nFans can learn more about Mirz\'s show at mirztour.com.\n\nTickets for the event can be purchased online at angelinaarts.org or at the box office the night of the event if still available.\n\nThe show starts at 7 p.m.', 'source': {'uri': 'lufkindailynews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Lufkin Daily News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'josh_havard@lufkindailynews.com', 'name': 'Josh Havard', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/lufkindailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/22/122d7c6b-1cf5-53eb-a7ad-da73ad059c7a/669712ad31a56.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1137254901960785, 'wgt': 458875483, 'relevance': 33}

Kevin had died in his sleep while out of town. He was 39.\n\nIt didn\'t make sense, Tom thought. His father saved people\'s lives. How could he lose his own while he was sleeping?\n\nA few weeks later, an autopsy report said the cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest possibly related to a calcified aortic valve.\n\nWere Kevin\'s heart problems genetic? Might he have passed something on to Tom and his siblings - Karen and brother, Brian? They went to a cardiologist to find out.\n\nNo problems were detected.\n\nNearly a decade later, one of Kevin\'s brothers began having fainting spells. He went to see a doctor about it. He mentioned that his (and Kevin\'s) mother had a history of seizures.\n\nThis led to genetic testing, something fairly new at the time and far more advanced than the screening Tom and his siblings had gone through.\n\nKevin\'s brother - thus, Tom\'s uncle - was found to have a marker for long QT syndrome, a condition that affects the heart\'s electrical system.\n\nEach heartbeat is mapped as five separate electrical waves. The electrical activity that occurs between the Q and T waves is called the QT interval. It shows electrical activity in the heart\'s lower chambers. A long QT interval can cause sudden, uncontrollable fast heart rhythms. The condition is rare, and not everyone who has it has dangerous heart rhythms. But when they do occur, they can be fatal.\n\nLooking back, the Sutch family could connect other episodes where the condition had likely gone undiagnosed - from seizures experienced by several family members to the sudden death of one of Kevin\'s sisters at age 13. And, of course, perhaps Kevin, too.\n\nSome 60 family members went for genetic testing. More than half tested positive, including Tom, Karen and Brian.\n\nThe doctor told the siblings that they would need to take beta blockers and have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator placed in the chest. If the device detects an abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers an electric shock to restore a normal heartbeat.\n\nTom got the defibrillator implanted just before returning to college for his senior year.\n\nAs difficult as that was, even worse was the litany of doctor\'s orders attached to the diagnosis: No strenuous activity, no heavy lifting and absolutely no contact sports. For a kid who grew up playing street hockey, then moved onto the ice, it was the end of his life as he knew it.\n\n"I was young and energetic with nowhere to put my energy," Tom said. "I just wanted to move my body."\n\nNeeding some outlet, he went jogging for the first time in his life. It soon became a positive among all the negatives.\n\nA couple years later, the family found a new electrophysiologist. This doctor was a runner, too, and he reassured Tom that his body wasn\'t as fragile as the previous specialist suggested.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"He made me feel like we could have normal lives if we do things with caution, instead of living our lives in fear of what could happen," Tom said.\n\nIn 2009, when he was 25, Tom ran his first half-marathon, training every week with childhood friends. Three years later, he ran a full marathon.\n\n"Running made me healthier, gave me discipline and resilience and, above all, it brought me a lot of joy," he said.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2013, Tom\'s defibrillator started beeping. That meant the battery was low and he\'d need a new device.\n\nTom\'s recovery from the replacement surgery took longer than the original implant. His doctor advised him to not run for several months.\n\nTom gained weight, lost muscle mass and sunk into a depression. But he vowed to turn himself around by the following spring. To do that, he set his sights on a bigger goal: the New York City Marathon.\n\nTom finished the 2015 race, calling it "one of the most demanding and rewarding experiences of my life."\n\nThree years later, he did it again.\n\nSince then, Tom, who lives in Brooklyn and works for a television network in creative marketing, keeps upping the ante.\n\nA few years ago, he joined a hockey league. He wears extra padding to protect his defibrillator and keeps an eye on his heart rate.\n\n"It feels especially good because hockey was taken away from me," Tom said.\n\nBrian, now 42, also recently started playing hockey. Both he and Karen, who is 38, are each married with three children.\n\nTom\'s mother, Kim Halpin, has since remarried. She said that although the initial news about long QT was devastating, she didn\'t want it to define her children.\n\n"They could be afraid of everything, but they\'ve been trying to go on with their lives and not be in hiding," she said. "I\'m sure their father would want to see them happy."\n\nShe and Tom pointed to continued research and science, especially gene therapy, as good signs.\n\n"There\'s hope that future generations won\'t face the same uncertainties and challenges my family faced," Tom said. "We know more about long QT and are getting better at managing it. Medication is preferred over invasive surgery."\n\nThis year, Tom turned 40.\n\n"Even with all these personal accomplishments and proud moments, I can\'t help but feel the void of not having my dad there to see them," he said. "While I may never fully know the man he was, I try to live my life in a way that honors him."\n\nStories From the Heart chronicles the inspiring journeys of heart disease and stroke survivors, caregivers and advocates.\n\nAmerican Heart Association News\n\ncovers heart and brain health.

Mini is open to reintroducing manual transmissions, possibly in an electric vehicle. Potential return of manual transmissions could be seen in upcoming JCW Cooper model, where take rates have historically been high.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of car enthusiasts, the 2025 Mini lineup no longer includes any manual transmissions; both the 2025 Mini Cooper and 2025 Mini Countryman send power through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Speaking with Vice President of Mini of the Americas Michael Peyton, this may not be the case forever. Although manual transmissions are less popular than their two-pedal alternatives, their gradual extinction has been noticed by keen driving enthusiasts, and many automakers are reevaluating whether to introduce the stick shift.\n\n"I wouldn\'t say never on the manual transmission," Peyton told CarBuzz on Mini Takes the States, an event where owners drive across multiple US states. "It\'s not a never again."\n\n2025 Mini John Cooper Works Countryman ALL4\n\n7.6/10\n\nWhat is Buzzscore?\n\nWhy The Manual Died\n\nMini used to offer a manual transmission on every single model but has since moved away from it due to several factors, including low take rate and global emissions regulations. "The manual take rate was only around 6% for the whole brand, though the Cooper three-door was much higher," Peyton explained. In the final year it was offered, the John Cooper Works Cooper three-door saw a 51% take rate. The Cooper S was much lower at around 22%.\n\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\n\nFollow On\n\nGoogle News\n\nPeyton explained that keeping the manual transmission became a scale issue, even if the take rate was higher. As a reminder, Mini sold 33,497 units in the US last year (2023), which was a 13.5% increase from 2022. Even counting global sales, Mini sold 295,358 units worldwide. To put that into perspective, Mini\'s parent company BMW sold 362,244 units in the US alone. To continue offering a second transmission for such a low-volume product would be a tough business case.\n\nClose\n\nWhen Could The Manual Return?\n\nIt\'s unclear what form the manual transmission could take in the future, but Peyton said Mini was "looking into" ways to offer some form of shifting in an electric vehicle. We presume it could be similar to what Hyundai offers in the Ioniq 5 N, which has received rave reviews. This is only speculation on our part, but Mini could also tap into its heritage by giving EV owners the ability to choose from iconic sounds, such as the original Cooper or the supercharged (later turbocharged) GP model.\n\nIf Mini wants to bring back the manual in a traditional sense, CarBuzz suggests Mini satisfies the demand by offering the transmission as an option on the upcoming JCW Cooper, which has yet to be announced, since that model had the highest take rate in previous years. If you were holding out on buying a new Mini with a third pedal, there may be a small glimmer of hope. Our prediction: you may not have to wait much longer.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Manual Performance Alternatives For Half The Price Of The 2025 BMW M2\n\nYou\'ve got plenty of manual sports coupes to pick from for half the price of a 2025 BMW M2.', 'source': {'uri': 'carbuzz.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CarBuzz'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jared_rosenholtz@carbuzz.com', 'name': 'Jared Rosenholtz', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cobb-testfest-021122-19532v2-1.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0980392156862746, 'wgt': 458862821, 'relevance': 56}

Production version will have traditional seating, underpinned by the E-GMP platform and offer two powertrain options. Potentially named Ioniq 9, this SUV aims to rival the Kia EV9 with a more conservative design and tech-laden cabin.\n\nHyundai has announced that it will introduce an all-new electric SUV this year. Almost no information was provided, with the automaker only confirming that the new arrival will have three rows of seating and that the world premiere will take place "later in 2024." Despite the vagueness of the announcement, it\'s all but assured that the Korean automaker is referring to the production version of the Hyundai Seven Concept, revealed near the end of 2021. Much like the Kia Concept EV9, this futuristic electric SUV envisioned a cabin where occupants are perched on a curved bench or swiveling lounge chairs, but the production version of the Kia SUV suggests a much more toned-down approach.

In the EV9, two powertrain options are on offer, with the standard one comprising a 76.1 kWh battery and a 215-horsepower rear motor.\n\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\n\nFollow On\n\nGoogle News\n\nAlternatively, a 99.8 kWh battery can be had for up to 300 miles of range, or you can step up to a dual-motor variant with 379 hp and AWD. There\'s also a high-performance EV9 GT coming next year, so we wouldn\'t be surprised if Hyundai\'s seven-seater is later offered in Ioniq 7 N form. Or would that be Ioniq 9 N form?\n\nClose\n\nHyundai Doesn\'t Know What To Call Its EV9 Alternative\n\nAs we touched on earlier, the concept of Korea\'s new electric SUV was called the Seven, so it makes sense for the production version to get similar nomenclature so that buyers make the association, especially since when the Ioniq sub-brand was launched, a three-row SUV called the 7 was said to be in the works. However, with the Kia EV9 using a higher number, Hyundai may be worried that consumers may think the Ioniq SUV is a lesser vehicle than its nearly identical Kia cousin.\n\nAccording to insider sources, the Ioniq 7 may be renamed Ioniq 9, and if true, this would open up more opportunities for niche-filling in the future. With little to go on for now, we can only wait for more information from Hyundai, but spy shots suggest a more conservative design than the EV9 on the outside and a tech-laden experience in the cabin.

Temperatures in the past have reached 115 degrees (46 Celsius), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nOakland will share the ballpark with the San Francisco Giants\' Triple-A River Cats, necessitating up to 153 regular-season games over 186 days.

"We picked the playing surface in consultation with the MLBPA and Murray Cook, and it has a specific hydration component to it in terms of water being added to it to cool the surface."\n\nMLB said choosing the underlying infrastructure beneath the turf was still in the process of being finalized.\n\nFive of MLB\'s 30 ballparks currently have artificial turf, four with retractable roofs and the Tampa Bay Rays\' Tropicana Field with a fixed dome. Outdoor stadiums with artificial turf led to extremely high field temperatures from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s. Former Cardinals third baseman Keith Hernandez in 2010 recalled the surface temperature in St. Louis reaching 148 (64 Celsius), causing the cleats of outfielder Reggie Smith to melt.\n\nA new home clubhouse is being planned for behind home plate but the visiting clubhouse will remain beyond the outfield.

"At the point in time they make that determination is when we lean in to ensure the health and safety and well-being of the players that are going to play there. Obviously, there\'s been a lot of dialogue of late about the warmth and the time of day and the scheduling."\n\nOakland\'s lease at the Coliseum expires after this season, and the A\'s announced in the spring of 2023 their intent to move to Las Vegas.

The A\'s asked that a non-relocation agreement include a provision for up to eight home games a year to be played elsewhere -- MLB picks teams for international events at special U.S. sites such as the Field of Dreams location in Iowa.\n\n"I talk to John regularly. I am comfortable with the progress they\'ve made with respect to the construction of the stadium in Las Vegas and his ability to put together the financing necessary to get that stadium constructed," Manfred said.\n\nOakland Mayor Sheng Thao faces a possible recall election in November.

It's a dream come true for those who want it all, but it doesn't quite match the raw power of the Tesla Model S Plaid.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual-motor\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-speed\n\nHorsepower\n\n1,111 HP\n\nTorque\n\n1,025 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n2.5 seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n168 MPH\n\nWith a dual-motor setup producing 1,111 horsepower and 1,025 pound-feet of torque, the Dream Edition Performance can accelerate from 0 to 60 MPH in 2.5 seconds. Its top speed of 168 MPH is nothing to scoff at, especially considering the level of luxury and comfort it offers. While the Lucid Air Sapphire might push the EV boundaries a bit more, the Dream Edition Performance still delivers a first-class experience, even if it doesn't quite stack up to the blistering speeds of the Model S Plaid.\n\nModel Overview\n\n2024 Cadillac Celestiq: A Comprehensive Guide On Features, Specs, And Pricing\n\nThe Cadillac Celestiq is GM's first all-electrc luxury sedan, and this comprehensive guide will tell you everything we know so far.\n\n10 Cadillac Celestiq\n\nTop Speed: 168 MPH\n\nWrapping up our list, the Cadillac Celestiq is the grand finale, bringing a bold move into the future for this classic American brand. This beauty combines cutting-edge technology with a touch of old-school luxury. We've chosen the Celestiq for its innovative features and jaw-dropping design, making it a standout in the luxury electric vehicle market. Cadillac is fully embracing the EV future without falling into a tacky design category.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual-motor\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-speed\n\nHorsepower\n\n1,000 HP\n\nTorque\n\n865 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n3.0 seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n168 MPH\n\nThe Celestiq's dual-motor setup cranks out 1,000 horsepower and 865 pound-feet of torque, letting it hit 60 MPH in around 3.0 seconds. With a top speed of 168 MPH, it's got plenty of oomph for a luxury sedan. Cadillac's dive into the electric world with the Celestiq shows it is serious about innovation while keeping that luxurious feel we all know and love. This car is a clear signal that Cadillac is ready to compete with the best in the electric vehicle market, even if it can't quite hit the Model S Plaid performance metrics.", 'source': {'uri': 'topspeed.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Top Speed'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'joshua_brown@topspeed.com', 'name': 'Joshua Brown', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/electric-cars-that-can-keep-up-with-the-tesla-model-s-plaid.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2313725490196079, 'wgt': 458853863, 'relevance': 30}

Finger-pointing has started\n\nHamburg Town Board members learned at this week\'s regular meeting there are some issues with renovations at the ice arena that could delay the winter hockey and skating season.\n\n"Pushing us back to Nov. 15 is really going to hurt Hamburg hockey," Dave McDermott, president of Hamburg Hawks Hockey, told Town Board members during a special meeting Monday night.\n\nHe said the club, which has about 600 children skating in house and travel teams, is scrambling to find ice time at other rinks. The travel teams are in good shape, and the club plans to go ahead with its house season, which usually starts in October, he said.\n\nPublic Works Superintendent Kenneth Kostowniak said opening the rink Nov. 15 would be the "best case" scenario.\n\nTown Board members approved $63,000 in change orders to cover repairs that were discovered when the renovations started in mid-April, after the last season ended and the ice melted two days later, officials said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He said Tuesday he still believes that.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe board voted in May to borrow $3 million for a $4.5 million project that includes improvements to the refrigeration and dehumidification systems, the demolition and replacement of the ice rink flooring and related cooling pipes, and improvements to the locker room and restroom facilities.\n\nBoard members said they were unaware of the possible lengthy delay until last week\'s meeting, when a member of the public said he\'d heard the ice arena would not be available until December or January.\n\nKostowniak said Monday he did not have all the information on the repairs needed, and cost estimates, until the day after that meeting.\n\n"It put a lot of fear in the hockey community," Council Member Daniel Kozub said.\n\nIn addition to hockey, the arena also is home to the adaptive skating program Gliding Stars, learn to skate and figure skating, skate and shoot and open skate programs.\n\nOne of the change orders involves shortening the rink from 207 feet long to the NHL length of 200 feet. Kostowniak said that helps the project, giving more room between new locker rooms and the ice.\n\nThe most expensive change order is $32,000 to fix the uneven subfloor. Kostowniak said the biggest delay now will be waiting for the concrete pad to cure, which will take 28 days.\n\n"I want to make sure this is built right," the public works superintendent said. "I\'m not going to get hung up on a deadline."\n\nThe board directed Kostowniak to send a status report every Friday afternoon to board members and is requiring the contractor to update the board at the start of every work session.\n\nBoard members also scheduled an informational meeting for the public to receive updates at 4 p.m. Aug. 19.\n\n0 Comments Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Bob Menendez was convicted on Tuesday of all the counts he faced at his corruption trial, including accepting bribes of gold and cash from three New Jersey businessmen and acting as a foreign agent for the Egyptian government.\n\nThe jury\'s verdict followed a nine-week trial in which prosecutors said the Democrat abused the power of his office to protect allies from criminal investigations and enrich associates, including his wife, through acts that included meeting with Egyptian intelligence officials and helping that country access millions of dollars in U.S. military aid.\n\nMenendez did not testify but insisted publicly he was only doing his job as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said the hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash found in his New Jersey home was legally earned, and that gold bars hidden there belonged to his wife.\n\nThe verdict, delivered at a federal courthouse in Manhattan, comes four months before Election Day and potentially dooms Menendez\'s chances of campaigning for reelection as an independent candidate.\n\nThe trial was the second time that the New Jersey Democrat has faced corruption allegations. An earlier prosecution on unrelated charges in 2017 ended with a deadlocked jury.\n\nMenendez, 70, did not testify.

In two separate notes, the jury had posed questions about the charges, including asking in one instance if unanimity was required to acquit "on a single count."\n\n"It\'s obvious that the government\'s case is not as simple as they made it to be," Menendez said before repeating himself. "It\'s not as simple as they made it to be. The jury\'s finding that out."\n\nDuring closing arguments last week, lawyers spent over 15 hours urging jurors to carefully study the evidence.\n\nProsecutors cited numerous instances when they said Menendez helped the businessmen. And they argued that his efforts to speed $99 million in helicopter ammunition to Egypt, along with cozy communications with top Egyptian officials, showed he was serving Egypt\'s interests as an agent.\n\nLawyers for Menendez insisted the senator never accepted bribes and that actions he took to benefit the businessmen were the kinds of tasks expected of a public official.

However, you should never underestimate the perseverance of those who do not wish to be found. Regardless of the reason, many people are actively trying to disappear online - and they\'ll go to enormous lengths to successfully do it.\n\nMaking sense of that particular puzzle represents the daily grind of a skip tracing professional. These are hardworking men and women who locate those who do not wish to be found, often reuniting creditors with the debtors who seem to have vanished overnight. If skip tracing sounds a bit like finding a needle in a (digital) haystack, that\'s because it often feels that way. But it\'s every bit as much an art as it is a science for several reasons, all of which are worth a closer look.\n\nSkip Tracing: The Tools of the Trade\n\nFor many years, public record databases have been a big part of the toolbox of any skip tracing professional. Certain types of documents -- like those about past or active court cases -- are very difficult to truly "hide" from. Skip tracers look over court documents, car registrations, and even voter registrations -- all in the name of trying to figure out where someone is based on where they likely were.\n\nBut thanks to the rate at which technology continues to advance, the types of "databases" that skip tracers can draw information from are constantly changing. Social media platforms can tell you who someone is friends with and who they\'ve recently interacted with. If you know how to use more advanced search techniques on a site like Google, you may uncover someone\'s personal website or an online profile you didn\'t know existed. Even reverse phone lookup services have changed the game in terms of what is possible and how quickly you can accomplish it.\n\nAs the volume of information that skip tracers work with has changed, many find success in combining cutting-edge technologies with old-school detective work. This has proven to be a great match in terms of finding hidden clues to navigate the murky online world someone might be attempting to hide in.\n\nFor the sake of example, say you were looking for a person, and you happened to find their personal Facebook profile. It is short on actionable information, but it does lead you to the profile of someone they know who is much more open. If you do enough digging, you may even find their phone number.\n\nA skip tracer would either call them directly to see if they can help get into contact with the target or use a reverse phone lookup service to find out more information about their address and other contact details. This would then help the skip tracer determine a more precise geographic area that they should be focusing their efforts on.\n\nThe Intrigue of Skip Tracing\n\nAgain, even in the digital realm, there\'s no hiding from a skilled investigator. Think about the fact that most people take photos these days with a smartphone. That smartphone contains a GPS chip -- that\'s how you\'re able to use apps like Waze to get turn-by-turn directions to a destination.\n\nAs a byproduct of that, the GPS chip adds precise location metadata to any photo you take unless you expressly turn it off - which most people don\'t do. If the target takes a photo and uploads it to Facebook, a skilled investigator might be able to download it, read that location metadata, and see exactly where it was taken.\n\nOf course, these have been mostly straightforward examples of what it is possible to do with the power of modern technology by your side. There\'s nothing stopping anyone from scouring over someone\'s Facebook profile to get a sense of their whereabouts - it doesn\'t take a seasoned skip tracer to do that.\n\nData mining and analysis tools, on the other hand, are a bit more sophisticated. Based on the sheer volume of data you collect, these tools can help you identify trends and patterns that you may otherwise have missed. They can even use past location data to predict where someone might be headed with an accuracy far greater than a human might be able to on their own.\n\nThere is also a wide range of digital forensics tools that professional skip tracers often employ. Data can be recovered and analyzed from virtually any source, such as smartphones or other types of electronic devices.\n\nThis is all that is meant by saying that skip tracing is a bit like finding a needle in a digital haystack. Not only could the person you\'re trying to find be virtually anywhere but there are also so many techniques you can use to begin your search. But soon enough, little by little, you do begin to chip away at the facade they\'ve constructed for themselves. At that point, you begin to realize that finding them is truly only a matter of "when," not "if." From that point of view, the digital skip tracer and the old-school detective do have a lot in common.\n\nIn the end, skip tracing is about a lot more than using modern technology to locate those who have "skipped town" (no pun intended). It\'s primarily following a trail of clutches that will help people solve a mystery -- one that just happens to be taking place primarily in the digital world.\n\nYes, sometimes that involves a debt collector trying to find someone who is going to great lengths to avoid paying that which they rightfully owe. But it\'s also about shining a light into the digital shadows. It\'s used in real estate, in the legal profession, and more - and it\'s a technique that is only going to get more powerful as technology continues to advance over the next decade and beyond.', 'source': {'uri': 'tntmagazine.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TNT Magazine'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.tntmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shutterstock_1695248794-jpg.webp', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.09019607843137245, 'wgt': 458843777, 'relevance': 32}

There\'s no doubt in my mind," said 1984 Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, now a commentator for NBC Sports. "When it becomes systemic, that\'s a whole different issue."\n\nProminent figures such as Katie Ledecky, winner of more individual swimming medals than any other female, and Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian ever with a staggering 23 gold medals, have both gone public with their complaints about a system that seems to have dropped the ball on a very clear-cut case.\n\n"I have moved on to the next chapter in my life," said Phelps, who retired after the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. "But it is imperative that we keep the book open for those who wish to be next."\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency kept the book closed on 23 elite Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned heart medication ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Five of those swimmers went on to win medals, including three golds.\n\nThe positive tests had been kept under wraps until they were reported in April by The New York Times and German broadcaster ARD. The Times further revealed that three of those swimmers had previously tested positive for another banned substance -- again, with no ramifications.\n\nWADA accepted the explanation of Chinese anti-doping officials that its athletes had ingested the banned substance through contaminated food at a hotel. World Aquatics, the governing body of swimming, went along with that decision.\n\n"It should have been handled differently -- for a matter of respect. Respect for the entire swimming and sports world," Italian swimmer Nicolò Martinenghi said. "The situation needs to be fixed."\n\nWith 11 swimmers who tested positive ahead of Tokyo set to compete again in Paris, criticism of the world\'s anti-doping regulator only increased.\n\n"If the international sports world continues to have its integrity impacted by the failures at WADA, the next generation isn\'t going to be able to have the same belief that I once had in the system," Phelps said during recent testimony before the U.S. Congress. "So with this I urge you, the members of Congress, to engage in the fight against doping. We can uphold the values and fairness and integrity that are the cornerstone of Olympic and Paralympic sport."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nTo that end, the U.S. has launched a criminal investigation into how the Chinese doping cases were handled. Brent Nowicki, the executive director of World Aquatics, has been subpoenaed to testify before Congress. World Aquatics said Monday that the Chinese swimmers going to Paris were undergoing increased drug testing of at least eight times this year before the Games.\n\nBut all of this comes too late to make it up to those who may have been cheated out of medals in Tokyo.\n\nTake Ledecky, who swam a stellar anchor leg on the 4x200-meter freestyle relay to finish off a time that would\'ve broken the previous world record, only to have a Chinese squad that included Zhang Yufei go even faster by four-tenths of a second to take both the gold and the world record. Zhang was among those who failed the pre-Olympic doping test.\n\nLedecky now knows what a swimmer like Shirley Babashoff, who was dubbed "Surly Shirley" for griping about the sudden rise of the East Germans at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, must\'ve felt like -- especially when her suspicions were proven to be correct.\n\n"It\'s tough to accept as an athlete, and now also to feel what it\'s like to be an athlete who won a (silver) medal behind some athletes who tested positive," Ledecky told CBS. "I\'ve seen it before with other athletes and always felt for those athletes."\n\nThe doping revelations are sure to cast a pall over the swimming competition in Paris -- especially if the Chinese have a strong performance.\n\nThey were fourth in the medal table at the Tokyo Games with three golds and six medals overall, and they are coming off a stellar showing at the 2024 world championships in Doha, Qatar, with seven golds and a total of 11 medals. China trailed only the United States at that meet, though it must be noted that many top swimmers skipped the most recent worlds because of its unusual timing in an Olympic year.\n\n"It\'s disappointing to have this kind of distraction again around the Olympics," said Tim Hinchey, the executive director of USA Swimming.\n\nThen again, it\'s nothing new for the sport.\n\n"It\'s happened time and time again," Hinchey said. "So that\'s disappointing."\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf in Rome contributed to this report.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

There\'s no doubt in my mind," said 1984 Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, now a commentator for NBC Sports. "When it becomes systemic, that\'s a whole different issue."\n\nProminent figures such as Katie Ledecky, winner of more individual swimming medals than any other female, and Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian ever with a staggering 23 gold medals, have both gone public with their complaints about a system that seems to have dropped the ball on a very clear-cut case.\n\n"I have moved on to the next chapter in my life," said Phelps, who retired after the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. "But it is imperative that we keep the book open for those who wish to be next."\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency kept the book closed on 23 elite Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned heart medication ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Five of those swimmers went on to win medals, including three golds.\n\nThe positive tests had been kept under wraps until they were reported in April by The New York Times and German broadcaster ARD. The Times further revealed that three of those swimmers had previously tested positive for another banned substance -- again, with no ramifications.\n\nWADA accepted the explanation of Chinese anti-doping officials that its athletes had ingested the banned substance through contaminated food at a hotel. World Aquatics, the governing body of swimming, went along with that decision.\n\n"It should have been handled differently -- for a matter of respect. Respect for the entire swimming and sports world," Italian swimmer Nicolò Martinenghi said. "The situation needs to be fixed."\n\nWith 11 swimmers who tested positive ahead of Tokyo set to compete again in Paris, criticism of the world\'s anti-doping regulator only increased.\n\n"If the international sports world continues to have its integrity impacted by the failures at WADA, the next generation isn\'t going to be able to have the same belief that I once had in the system," Phelps said during recent testimony before the U.S. Congress. "So with this I urge you, the members of Congress, to engage in the fight against doping. We can uphold the values and fairness and integrity that are the cornerstone of Olympic and Paralympic sport."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nTo that end, the U.S. has launched a criminal investigation into how the Chinese doping cases were handled. Brent Nowicki, the executive director of World Aquatics, has been subpoenaed to testify before Congress. World Aquatics said Monday that the Chinese swimmers going to Paris were undergoing increased drug testing of at least eight times this year before the Games.\n\nBut all of this comes too late to make it up to those who may have been cheated out of medals in Tokyo.\n\nTake Ledecky, who swam a stellar anchor leg on the 4x200-meter freestyle relay to finish off a time that would\'ve broken the previous world record, only to have a Chinese squad that included Zhang Yufei go even faster by four-tenths of a second to take both the gold and the world record. Zhang was among those who failed the pre-Olympic doping test.\n\nLedecky now knows what a swimmer like Shirley Babashoff, who was dubbed "Surly Shirley" for griping about the sudden rise of the East Germans at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, must\'ve felt like -- especially when her suspicions were proven to be correct.\n\n"It\'s tough to accept as an athlete, and now also to feel what it\'s like to be an athlete who won a (silver) medal behind some athletes who tested positive," Ledecky told CBS. "I\'ve seen it before with other athletes and always felt for those athletes."\n\nThe doping revelations are sure to cast a pall over the swimming competition in Paris -- especially if the Chinese have a strong performance.\n\nThey were fourth in the medal table at the Tokyo Games with three golds and six medals overall, and they are coming off a stellar showing at the 2024 world championships in Doha, Qatar, with seven golds and a total of 11 medals. China trailed only the United States at that meet, though it must be noted that many top swimmers skipped the most recent worlds because of its unusual timing in an Olympic year.\n\n"It\'s disappointing to have this kind of distraction again around the Olympics," said Tim Hinchey, the executive director of USA Swimming.\n\nThen again, it\'s nothing new for the sport.\n\n"It\'s happened time and time again," Hinchey said. "So that\'s disappointing."\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf in Rome contributed to this report.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

However, Fleming\'s name was bypassed in the blind draw and he was placed in the back of the field.

Their relationship continued afterward with Schy launching a series of junior tournaments in their native California in 2023 to make competitive golf more affordable for talented young players.\n\nThe Central Valley Jon DeChambeau Memorial Junior Tour - named in tribute to the two-time major champion\'s father - was born but after a successful pilot event and a smattering of other tournaments, DeChambeau and Schy\'s relationship turned sour.

It kicked off early this morning, and while through Wednesday, July 17.\n\nPrime Day is Amazon\'s biggest sale event of the year, when you can save big across 35 categories, from tech to home goods to clothes. Prime members can shop for new deals as often as every five minutes during select periods of the event and partake in exclusive invite-only deals.\n\nAlso: The best Prime Day deals right now\n\nIn 2023, Prime members bought more than 375 million items and saved over $2.5 billion across the shopping site, the largest year on record for Amazon, according to the company. Since last July\'s Prime Day sale, the company has held a Prime Big Deal Days sale in October and, in March, promoted a Big Spring Sale for the first time. Read on for everything you need to know about this year\'s Prime Day sale, including some deals you can shop for now.\n\nAlso: The best anti-Prime Day deals you can shop at Best Buy, Walmart, and beyond\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about Amazon is you\'ll find top deals on Amazon exclusive products, tech, home, and everything in between. Here\'s a look at some top tech deals we\'ve found scouring Amazon\'s Prime Day page for the best savings.\n\nPrime Day is always packed with deals across every category, especially flagship Amazon products like Echo devices, Fire TVs, Kindles, and more. Amazon says shoppers can anticipate deals across 35 categories, including home, tech, and more. During October Prime Day 2023, ZDNET readers scooped up savings on Fire Sticks, AirPods, chargers, and security cameras the most, but these Prime Day sales typically include many products.\n\nAlso: The 10 most popular October Prime Day deals among ZDNET readers\n\nAmazon shared in its release that Prime members can expect to jump on back-to-school savings and college essentials, find deep discounts across the site, and find deals on "new and popular" brands only available on Amazon for the upcoming event.\n\nSince the event kicked off, we\'re seeing similar prices as offered during the days leading up to the sale on Amazon products like Fire Sticks, Echo devices, Fire TVs, Kindles, and more. Some Apple products, like the Watch SE and Series 9 have dropped below pre-Prime Day offerings, and many lifestyle and home products, like Dyson vacuums, dropped in price overnight, too.\n\nPrime Day not only slashes prices on many top products on Amazon (across 35 categories, to be exact), but it also sparks generous competition among other major retailers such as Walmart, Target, Costco, Best Buy, and more. This means that you have a good chance of scoring a product you\'ve been eyeing for a discount of 30%, 40%, 50%, and even more at Amazon, or nabbing the very same or even better discount elsewhere.\n\nPlus, Prime Day is typically worth it for Amazon-exclusive products like Fire TVs, Fire tablets, Echo devices, Ring doorbells and cameras, Fire Sticks, and more (really, we\'re already seeing discounts of over 50% on these items). While sale periods can sometimes be tricky to know if you\'re getting the best deal, Prime Day generally does bring legitimate discounts, especially on tech. Remember, we\'re already seeing new smartphones, TVs, tablets, and more releases, which means more savings are incoming for older products.\n\nAmazon announced that Prime Day will return on Tuesday, July 16 and Wednesday, July 17. We\'ve been keeping up with all the best Prime Day news since Amazon\'s confirmation of their 10th annual Prime Day back in April, and we\'ll continue to cover all the best deals you can shop before, during, and after the popular event. Be sure to keep up with our Advice team on ZDNET.com throughout the sale. We\'ll be updating the site with all the details you need to shop savvy -- including the best deals on products we\'ve personally tested and would recommend.\n\nPrime Day 2024 will kick off on Tuesday, July 16 at 12:01 a.m. PT and will run through Wednesday, July 17. The sale will last 48 hours like in years past, though we fully expect to see a ton of deals drop before the event begins and linger for several days after. Plus, Amazon always has shoppable deals available you can explore.\n\nPrime Day is Amazon\'s most popular flagship seasonal savings event, typically in mid-July each year. Although Amazon has since branched out to add an October Prime event and other sales, this July Prime Day remains the holy grail of Amazon sales.\n\nPrime Day grants Amazon Prime members exclusive access to deals on Amazon.com across all categories, including home, tech, apparel, and more.\n\nAmazon\'s Prime Day is an exclusive sale for Amazon Prime members. If you\'re not a member, you can always sign up for a 30-day free trial. (If you\'re a student, you may be eligible for a discounted Prime Student membership, which includes a 6-month free trial.)\n\nTechnically, yes. Prime Day is an exclusive Prime members-only event. You must purchase a membership or start a free trial to participate. You can always sign up for a 30-day free trial for those who aren\'t members.\n\nLook at you, two steps ahead. Yes, there are loopholes to enjoying the Amazon sale if you aren\'t already a Prime member or don\'t want to become one permanently. A popular tactic is to sign up for a free 30-day trial, shop your favorite steals, and cancel before the 30 days are up to avoid getting charged.\n\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the US, and the UK are the participating countries.\n\nAmazon Prime costs $14.99 per month, or you can purchase an annual membership for $139, saving you a few dollars.\n\nAlso: These 5 new Amazon features make finding the products you need even easier\n\nAll college students and those aged 18-24 are eligible for a discount and can pay $7.49 per month or $69 per year. In addition, those with qualified government assistance (which may include select seniors) can receive a Prime membership for just $6.99 after their free trial.\n\nJoin Amazon Prime or start your free trial here: https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\n\nAmazon is known for its annual Prime Day event in mid-July. Prime Day began in July 2015, on the company\'s 20th birthday. However, the retail giant has recently expanded its sale periods to become more frequent. For the past two years, Amazon added a sale called Prime Big Deal Days in October, colloquially dubbed "October Prime Day." We expect the same for this year.\n\nFrom March 20-25, 2024, Amazon launched its first-ever Big Spring Sale, a sale event expected to appear again next year.\n\nIn 2020, Amazon ran its Prime Day sale event in October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in October 2022, the retail giant offered a "Prime Day Early Access" sale event, and most recently, in October 2022, Amazon ran an "October Prime Day" for the first time. Since we also saw an October Prime Day in 2023, we anticipate another Prime-related sale event will pop up in October 2024.\n\nThroughout the sale, we\'ll be extensively updating ZDNET.com live with all the best deals on products we\'ve tested and would recommend. We\'ll also curate, share, and update hand-picked lists of top deals in several product categories, including laptops, security cameras, tablets, Amazon devices, and more.\n\nAmazon also offers "Lightning Deals" during its sale events, which are time- and inventory-sensitive. Look for this tag on any products you want to purchase -- if you see it, you may want to check it out -- and fast. Throughout select periods during Prime Day, new deals will continue to drop as often as every 5 minutes. Plus, invite-only deals are back. Prime members can also request an invitation to access invite-only deals -- exclusive Prime Day deals Amazon is anticipating to sell out.\n\nYes, Prime Day has officially kicked off, and you can shop the site. We\'ll be extensively covering the best deals throughout the sale, including operating a live blog all day on the hottest Prime Day grabs.\n\nAlso: The best Prime Day deals: Live updates\n\nPrime Day brings discounts across nearly 35 categories (some of the best being in tech). There are not necessarily specific items to avoid, but remember to keep your eyes out for discounts and listing prices. Sometimes, during big savings events, it\'s hard to tell what\'s really a "discount." If you\'re checking in with all of ZDNET\'s Prime Day content, don\'t worry -- we\'ll be expert-vetting deals to ensure they\'re worth your money. If you\'re shopping on your own, make sure to do some research on historical pricing using tools like Google Shopping and more.\n\nAlso: Google expands its shopping tools just in time for Amazon Prime Day. Here\'s how to use them\n\nYes, as we\'ve seen in the past, other major retailers will undoubtedly offer competing sales, deals, and discounts. Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and other retailers try to compete with Amazon\'s Prime Day offerings, often price-cutting the same items during the same periods or extending their own sales. We\'ll cover all the best deals on top tech during Amazon\'s Prime Day event, including deals surfacing elsewhere.\n\nThe answer here is hard to say. It\'s a yes, but also a no. Invite-only Prime deals -- or Lightning deals -- may be different each day. Amazon confirmed last month that new deals may surface as often as every five minutes on the site. As always, deals only last as long as Amazon decides, with lighting deals offering a countdown to their expiration, and other deals\' longevity depending on how fast products sell out (or don\'t).', 'source': {'uri': 'zdnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ZDNet'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/b8a79cb95f4083d72c569b9b2f79b11f60008559/2024/07/01/3ea08462-c66d-4355-961f-3ff912eba13d/prime-day-2024-6.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200', 'eventUri': 'eng-9735322', 'sentiment': 0.4352941176470588, 'wgt': 458835153, 'relevance': 26}

In turning to the 39-year-old Ohio senator, the Republican nominee injected new energy into a campaign that has centered in recent weeks on questions of age following President Joe Biden\'s disastrous debate performance. The Republican National Convention opened Monday less than 48 hours after Trump was the subject of a shocking assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Trump made a grand entrance, walking into the convention hall with a bandage over his injured right ear and waving to the crowd. The shooting, which left Trump injured and one man dead, loomed over the convention with speakers resolved to win back the White House.\n\nU.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle addressed the assassination attempt on Donald Trump during an interview with ABC News.\n\nBiden will speak Tuesday at the NAACP convention in Las Vegas, aiming to showcase his administration\'s support for Black voters who are a tentpole of the Democratic coalition.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the long answer is...well, also no but far better explained.\n\nIt told us, while breaking Kane down into three parts - team dependence, club choice and mentality and leadership: "It\'s definitely true that Kane seems to have come close to trophies a few times but missed out. Euro 2024 is a good example, and depending on how you view Tottenham\'s recent performance, you could argue they haven\'t capitalized on his talent in terms of silverware either.\n\nHere\'s the thing though, "unluckiest ever" is a tough label to place. There are many great players who never lifted a major trophy. Football is a team sport, and sometimes even the best individual talents can\'t carry a team all the way.\n\n"Football is a team sport, and winning trophies relies heavily on the collective strength and performance of the entire squad. Even a world-class striker like Kane can\'t single-handedly win a trophy if the rest of the team isn\'t on the same page or lacks the necessary depth and skill.\n\n"While a move to Bayern Munich aimed to address this, it didn\'t quite work out this past season. His future club choice will be crucial. If he joins a team that\'s consistently challenging for trophies but doesn\'t quite get there, the wait could extend.\n\n"Some players thrive under pressure and can inspire their teammates in big games. If Kane struggles in high-pressure situations or doesn\'t naturally take on a leadership role, it could hinder the team\'s overall performance."\n\nGemini did come up with some positives, and claimed that England could have a chance of winning the 2026 World Cup, with Kane\'s "individual brilliance" leading the way.\n\nAnd with Gareth Southgate resigning today, a new manager could lead the charge...we hope.\n\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters.', 'source': {'uri': 'dailystar.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Star'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'adam_cailler@dailystar.co.uk', 'name': 'Adam Cailler', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33257030.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Spain-v-England-Final-UEFA-EURO-2024.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9730753', 'sentiment': 0.1294117647058823, 'wgt': 458833138, 'relevance': 51}

Not the Brewers, not the league, not the World Series.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why: the disillusioning strike of 1994, the stodgy ultramarathon games and the fact Robin \'The Kid\' Yount couldn\'t play into his pensioner years. I used to celebrate my birthday at County Stadium with my softball glove, and Cecil Cooper and Ben Oglivie buttons. Then I grew up and left the Mark McGwire game entirely to cover football and basketball and everything else.\n\nDecades passed. And the game advanced so much in that time, and the statistics, the specialties, the hyper-specific scenarios that yielded analytics and metrics followed. There\'s stuff called WAR and WHIP and OBP+. There\'s a "hard hit rate" that kind of makes sense, but what the hell is rOBA?\n\nThere\'s Pull%, Cent% and Oppo% - something about batters and their tendencies - and Standard Fielding Pos and lgRFGs. Yuck.\n\nI look at baseball now the way a baby boomer looks at an Uber. You tell me I\'m supposed to trust it, but I don\'t ... and I can\'t remember my app password anyway.\n\nStill, there\'s something about this year, 2024. Major League Baseball finally made pitchers and batters pick up the pace in 2023, and this season these National League Central-leading Brewers became ... intriguing. Everyone in the clubhouse talks about the super-low expectations, and we all know underdog journeys really are the best stories. It was time to face my anxiety - I don\'t know this game, I don\'t understand these intricacies - and see if I could return to baseball. And learn its peculiar language.\n\nMedia. Watch games, listen to broadcasts and podcasts, and read the coverage.\n\nAnd stats - because no other sport marries itself to data more than this one.\n\nA natural place to start was Gold Glove-winner, MVP and all-around good-attitude dude Christian Yelich.\n\nOK, one of the stat websites - baseball-reference.com - features 12 pages. Batting average, plate appearances, home runs, stolen bases, RBIs. It starts with the usual stuff, all makes sense.\n\nAnd then ... OBP, OPS and OPS plus. And ... player value batting.\n\nMy anxiety levels rise. This is clearly a foreign language. I reach out to Jeff Levering, the very kind, very knowledgeable Brewers radio broadcaster. He will help translate.\n\n"I\'ll have to study up, some of these stats are like programming a VCR," he responded via text, and that is funny in more ways than one.\n\nOK, in the meantime, we can always count on broadcasters Brian Anderson and Bill Schroeder. They were calling a Brewers-Boston Red Sox game on June 2 and discussing the batting percentage leaders in the National League when they posited the question: does Yelich have a chance at the NL batting title?\n\nAnderson: A player needs 3.2 at-bat plate appearances per team games to qualify for the batting title. Yelich missed some time mid-April ...\n\nAs I\'m doing a Google search - who is Dom, Brewers? - Anderson and Schroeder jump back to the topic. Their man Dom reports the number is actually 3.1, not 3.2 and ... what were we talking about anyway?\n\nHe rolls his gaze - just a little. It\'s four hours before another game in a summer of endless games and the 32-year-old veteran has likely heard every question that ever existed. God, it must get old. But these stats! They make for endless talking points and debates and Yelich is a newly inducted member of some elite 200 club - career home runs and steals. So Yelich must have a great take on all this; what stats are good, and what are a joke; and which ones are really telling, and which are helpful, and ...\n\n"I don\'t even look at my stats; I couldn\'t tell you a single one of my stats right now. I have zero idea. Like no clue," he said. "They don\'t matter to me until the end of the season because they change so much. So I don\'t look at them."\n\nOh. But ... in general, there must be some stat that\'s valuable?\n\n"Not really. People talk about them - the media and the fans. I don\'t know. Players, like - we don\'t really care."\n\nAwkward silence. It\'s not a slammed door on this story idea but wow, if he doesn\'t care, should we? My anxiety alarms are blaring. This is the MVP who has come to Bucks games to watch the other MVP in town. This is a respected guy in Milwaukee. And he\'s killing this stat story project before its even started. Is he serious? One last weak attempt: BABIP? Does he care about that? Does he care about anything?\n\nBut it makes sense. When someone like Yelich works and trains and plays like he does, what purpose would it serve to look at numbers and trends?\n\n"I don\'t know why you\'d want to put yourself through looking at your stuff like every day," Yelich said. "I care about winning and trying to help the team win."\n\nIt means there\'s room for the rest of us to try to decode the numerical quirks and statistical quarks of the game without the pressure of trying to fake like we know it.\n\nLet\'s head out to the yard. Hey, at least baseball is an inviting sport to the spectator, unlike the dizzying flurry of football and frenetic pace of basketball. Baseball is polite, letting you gather your flock, find your spot and settle in to take in the weather, the people around you and the smell of the roasting hot dogs before you have to be alert.

Brown noted that his comments were not at all a slight on White, and he even called him to clarify the same and wished him the best for the 2024 Paris Olympics. He added that he and White are on good terms and there were no hard feelings on either side.\n\n"Absolutely, I called Derrick (White) right away. Just to make sure there\'s no confusion, my love for you and all of that. He knew that he did. You don\'t gotta always make anything public, but me and D-White are good."\n\nIt\'s good to hear that Brown and White haven\'t let the situation with Team USA affect their personal friendship and camaraderie. This news will cheer up Celtics fans, who must have been worried about Brown being snubbed in favor of White could have led to a series of events that would disrupt their team chemistry.\n\nWhile Brown isn\'t upset with Derrick White over the situation, that doesn\'t mean he isn\'t frustrated by the whole ordeal. When the news first broke that Team USA had picked Derrick White to be Kawhi Leonard\'s replacement, Brown made a cryptic post on social media.\n\nBrown even called out Nike for what he feels was their alleged involvement in the decision, as Nike is one of Team USA\'s most powerful sponsors, and Brown is an Adidas signature athlete. However, that theory unravels when you consider that Anthony Edwards, Joel Embiid, and Stephen Curry are all signature athletes for other brands, and are still on the team.\n\nJaylen Brown Snubbed Because Of Fit And Role\n\nTeam USA\'s managing director Grant Hill addressed Brown\'s absence from the team.

Brown noted that his comments were not at all a slight on White, and he even called him to clarify the same and wished him the best for the 2024 Paris Olympics. He added that he and White are on good terms and there were no hard feelings on either side.\n\n"Absolutely, I called Derrick (White) right away. Just to make sure there\'s no confusion, my love for you and all of that. He knew that he did. You don\'t gotta always make anything public, but me and D-White are good."\n\nIt\'s good to hear that Brown and White haven\'t let the situation with Team USA affect their personal friendship and camaraderie. This news will cheer up Celtics fans, who must have been worried about Brown being snubbed in favor of White could have led to a series of events that would disrupt their team chemistry.\n\nWhile Brown isn\'t upset with Derrick White over the situation, that doesn\'t mean he isn\'t frustrated by the whole ordeal. When the news first broke that Team USA had picked Derrick White to be Kawhi Leonard\'s replacement, Brown made a cryptic post on social media.\n\nBrown even called out Nike for what he feels was their alleged involvement in the decision, as Nike is one of Team USA\'s most powerful sponsors, and Brown is an Adidas signature athlete.

There\'s his association with Dick Trickle and John Boegeman as the Blue Knight of the SuperAmerica stable. There\'s his win in the inaugural Oktoberfest feature at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway in 1970 and his championship win in the inaugural ARTGO Racing season during his dominant 1975 campaign.\n\nThen, there\'s how Colin Reffner, Tom\'s grandson who races super late models today, puts it.\n\n"His biggest impact on the racing world I think was that he, as well as many others, had a hand in what racing has become today," Colin Reffner said. "He was there when this technology changed and progressed with new cars being built. That was really the beginning stages of that."\n\nPeople are also reading...

Sleepy Hollows Auto Group is offering $8,888 to win in each race and a best average finish bonus means one driver can win $20,000 by sweeping both races.\n\nThe Central Wisconsin Racing Association -- a state-wide touring series that Tom Reffner claimed three championships in -- will run two 30-lap features on the quarter-mile track for the first time ever.\n\nThe event is being promoted by Gregg McKarns, the owner of Madison International Speedway. Colin said his grandfather goes way back with Gregg\'s father John and the entire McKarns family. The event also serves as the opening of the 133rd LaCrosse Interstate Fair.\n\n"It\'s fitting for him to do it and for it to be at La Crosse," Colin Reffner said. "I really think that Gregg, along with La Crosse and Sleepy Hollow Auto Group, have put together an amazing event."\n\nColin, with more than a decade of experience running Super Late Model races during La Crosse\'s Oktoberfest, will be among the 21 drivers entering the event as of Monday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nTy Majeski, a three-time winner of the Dick Trickle 99 and three-time Oktoberfest champion, returns to La Crosse in the midst of a busy slate for his full-time ride in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.\n\n"We\'ve always kind of seen the Truck Series, at least as long as I\'ve been in it, kind of structured this way," Majeski said. "Just business as usual. Two of the last three weeks I was in Sandusky and wasn\'t racing the late model too much."\n\nMajeski started the late model season with three dominant wins in the ASA Midwest Tour and another in the ASA Stars National Tour event at Madison. He\'s the points leader in both divisions.\n\nThe Reffner 88 will be the fourth of Majeski\'s five races in 10 days with a Truck Series race on Friday at Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park. His recent results have been mixed, failing to finish at Slinger Nationals or his Truck Series start at Pocono before a runner-up finish at Grundy County Speedway on Saturday.\n\nMajeski fell out of last season\'s Oktoberfest main event after an accident that involved 2018 ASA Midwest Tour champion Dalton Zehr. The Verona-based driver seeks redemption in the Reffner 88.\n\nJohnny Sauter, another former Oktoberfest winner and champion in both NASCAR Trucks and ASA, is also back looking for a bounce-back performance at La Crosse. Sauter was leading last year\'s Oktoberfest 200 late when a mechanical issue denied him a chance to race for the win.\n\nGabe Sommers won the chaotic Oktoberfest 200 and claimed the ASA Midwest Tour championship in his last visit to La Crosse. Sommers returns with momentum, securing a top-10 in his first Slinger Nationals feature and a fifth-place run at Grundy County last week.\n\nSommers is third in ASA Midwest Tour standings this season, sitting behind 19-year old Levon Van Der Geest. Van Der Geest, an engineering student at UW-Milwaukee who won last year\'s Rookie of the Year award, will make his return to La Crosse.\n\nTy Fredrickson, the 15-year old son of multi-time Oktoberfest champion Dan, has proven he\'s already capable of landing in victory lane. Fredrickson won the Icebreaker 100 at Dells Raceway Park on April 13 and leads the track\'s Alive for 5 Series through three events.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, veteran drivers Jeremy Lepak and Jeff Storm are among those competing Wednesday.\n\nSeveral NASCAR Kwik Trip Late Model regulars are scattered throughout the lineup including Jacob Goede, Nick Clements and Billy Mohn.

"Navy was the first offer that I picked up. I was actually thinking about enlisting in the military after high school anyway if I didn\'t play college football. This way, I can do both."\n\nDibble said that his father, Ryan, was in the Marines and that both of his grandfathers served in the Army, which was also a factor in his decision.\n\nDibble, who also received offers from Elon and Wofford, said he fell in love with Navy\'s campus in Annapolis, Maryland, and got to know defensive lineman Justin Reed during his official visit.\n\n"I met with seven of the players when I was up there and (Reed) talked to me for a few hours himself," Dibble said. "He told me that you make the experience whatever you want it be and to take advantage of the great coaching and the great training program for life after football."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDibble\'s recruiting stock began to rise after a stellar junior season when he recorded 132 tackles, including 28 for loss, and 11 sacks.\n\nHe said he grew about four inches between his sophomore and junior year and added about 15 pounds.\n\n"My brother, Joseph, who also played (at Atkins), is a personal trainer and I was lifting weights and working out with him a lot between my sophomore and junior year," Dibble said. "I went from about 5-11 and 215 pounds as a sophomore to 6-3 and 230 pounds as a junior. That made a big difference."\n\nDibble also credited former teammate Kadynce Watson, who also played defensive end for the Camels last season and is now playing at Fayetteville State, for helping his development.\n\nWatson finished the 2023 season with 145 tackles and 14 sacks.\n\n"The whole concept of \'Iron sharpens iron\'\', Dibble said. "We pushed each other in practice every day."\n\nDibble has played football for 11 years, starting with the Union Cross Bobcats program in Kernersville.\n\nThis season will mark his third straight as a team captain at Atkins, where he also plays lacrosse and is in the Chess Club and the Environmental Club. He will also see some playing time as a tight end.\n\n"You can expect even more leadership out of me this season," Dibble said. "I love playing football because I love to hit people. That\'s why I love playing defense. But I\'ll do anything I can to help us win."\n\nmpruitt@wsjournal.com\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'journalnow.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Winston-Salem Journal'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/journalnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/bd/3bd99d70-415a-11ef-8a32-db89f0184e26/6692f5b3e0bc7.social.jpg?resize=438%2C320', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2784313725490195, 'wgt': 458827790, 'relevance': 51}

Russia\'s telecom watchdog (Roskomnadzor) has demanded that Google unblock more than 200 YouTube accounts belonging to Russian media outlets, government bodies and politicians.\n\n"Roskomnadzor issued a message to Google LLC CEO Sundar Pichai demanding that more than 200 YouTube accounts of Russian media outlets, federal government bodies, companies and sports clubs, as well as various public and political activists and musicians who support Russia and its authorities be unblocked," it told TASS.\n\nThe watchdog recalled that since 2020, YouTube has imposed restrictions on 207 Russian entities, including 83 in 2024 alone.

Image Credit\n\nHong Kong\'s government is developing its own AI tool similar to ChatGPT, aimed initially at government employees but with plans for public availability. This initiative comes in response to OpenAI\'s recent decision to block access from Hong Kong and other unsupported regions.\n\nSun Dong, Hong Kong\'s Secretary for Innovation, Technology, and Industry, announced the development on a Saturday radio show. The AI tool, known in Chinese as "document assistance application for civil servants," is being tested and is expected to be rolled out to the entire government by the end of the year.\n\nThe project is spearheaded by a generative AI research and development centre at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, in collaboration with other universities. Future enhancements are expected to include functions for graphics and video design, though how these capabilities will compare to ChatGPT remains uncertain. Sun emphasized the need for local development due to the unavailability of support from global tech giants like Microsoft and Google.\n\nThe development of Hong Kong\'s AI tool is part of a broader context of technological competition between China and the United States, with both nations striving for AI supremacy. China aims to become the global leader in AI by 2030. However, OpenAI has excluded China, Hong Kong, and Macao from its list of supported regions, leading to the need for local solutions.\n\nOpenAI\'s recent measures to block connections from unsupported regions have been part of ongoing restrictions, though the company has not provided detailed reasons for these actions. Local IT expert Francis Fong expressed cautious optimism about Hong Kong\'s AI capabilities, suggesting that while it may not match ChatGPT, it could still achieve high standards with local input and tailored functionalities.\n\nOne advantage of a locally developed AI system is its ability to address regional languages and issues more accurately. However, given the political climate, there is an expectation that AI might conform to certain ideological constraints. This is particularly relevant in China, where internet content is heavily censored, and AI models must operate within these parameters.\n\nChinese tech companies like Alibaba and Baidu have already introduced AI models similar to ChatGPT, primarily for Chinese-language users, adhering to censorship rules. In May, China\'s cyberspace academy announced the training of an AI chatbot on President Xi Jinping\'s doctrine, underscoring the ideological boundaries within which Chinese AI operates.\n\nIn Hong Kong, SenseTime, a significant player in Chinese AI, launched SenseChat, which serves the Cantonese-speaking population.

How best to evaluate not only scores of transfers but also three incoming programs in Cal, Stanford and SMU?\n\nConsider, also, the conference's star power at quarterback. Three projected starters averaged at least 250 passing yards per game last year. Another averaged 261.2 while setting a Bowl Subdivision record for efficiency in 2021.\n\nNone played in the ACC last season.\n\nCam Ward, the nation's most prolific returning passer at 311.3 yards per game, transferred from Washington State to Miami. SMU's Preston Stone competed in the American Athletic Conference, while Syracuse's Kyle McCord helped Ohio State to an 11-1 regular season.\n\nGrayson McCall, he of the then-record 207.65 passer rating in 2021 at Coastal Carolina, could lead NC State to ACC contention this season.\n\nSo here's the ballot, due next week when the conference stages its annual media days in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nOFFENSE\n\nQuarterback: NC State's McCall. There are myriad quality choices, but Group of Five competition at Coastal notwithstanding, McCall's 88-14 career ratio of touchdown passes to interceptions is remarkable.\n\nRunning back: North Carolina's Omarion Hampton and Miami's Martinez. Hampton (115.7 yards per game) is the FBS' No. 2 returning rusher behind Oklahoma State's Ollie Gordon.\n\nReceiver: NC State's KC Concepcion, Louisville's Caullin Lacy and Miami's Xavier Restrepo. A transfer from South Alabama, Lacy is the nation's top returning pass-catcher (109.7 yards per game).\n\nTight end: North Carolina's Bryson Nesbit. A first-team selection last season, he'll have to adjust to life without quarterback Drake Maye.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nTackle: Florida State's Darius Washington and Miami's Jalen Rivers. Washington is the only offensive lineman returning from the 2023 All-ACC first team.\n\nGuard: SMU's Logan Parr and Louisville's Michael Gonzalez. Parr and teammate Justin Osborne were the first-team All-American Athletic Conference guards last season, and Osborne has moved inside to center.\n\nCenter: Virginia's Brian Stevens. Pro Football Focus graded him the league's best run-blocker at the position in 2023.\n\nAll-purpose: Virginia Tech's Bhayshul Tuten. He was the lone ACC player last year with multiple touchdowns rushing (10), receiving (two) and returning (two kickoffs).\n\nDEFENSE\n\nEnd: Louisville's Ashton Gillotte and Miami's Reuben Bain. This is the ACC's deepest position as eight of the 10 players who made all-league last season return, including Virginia Tech's Antwaun Powell-Ryland. Moreover, there are quality transfers such as Marvin Jones Jr. (Georgia to Florida State) and Fadil Diggs (Texas A&M to Syracuse).\n\nTackle: Florida State's Joshua Farmer and Virginia Tech's Aeneas Peebles. Pro Football Focus graded Peebles, then playing at Duke, second among all defensive tackles in pass rush last season.\n\nLinebacker: Miami's Francisco Mauigoa, Syracuse's Marlowe Wax and Clemson's Barrett Carter. Mauigoa recorded a league-best 15 solo tackles for loss last year.\n\nCornerback: NC State's Aydan White and Virginia Tech's Dorian Strong. From all accounts, Florida State's Azareye'h Thomas dominated spring practices, but 2023 third-team selections Strong and White are more established.\n\nSafety: Virginia's Jonas Sanker and Florida State's Shyheim Brown. Sanker (league-best 73 solo tackles) and Gillotte are the only All-ACC first-team defenders returning from last season.\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS\n\nSpecialist: SMU's Brashard Smith. Playing at Miami last season, Smith led the ACC with 579 yards in kickoff returns and earned second-team all-conference.\n\nKicker: North Carolina's Noah Burnette made 19 for 20 field goals and all 43 PATs last year. Virginia Tech's John Love and FSU's Ryan Fitzgerald also converted all of their PATs and more than 90% of their field goal attempts.\n\nPunter: Florida State's Alex Mastromanno. Flip a coin between Mastromanno and Duke's Porter Wilson. You can't go wrong.\n\nWhat's certain to go wrong is a subsequent column projecting the ACC's order of finish 1-17.\n\nSports Week in Pictures: Wimbledon, Tour de France gain momentum\n\nDavid Teel (804) 649-6546\n\ndteel@timesdispatch.com\n\nDavid Teel\n\nSports Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow David Teel Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

This installment: Linebackers.\n\nThe biggest addition to the Buffalo Bills\' 2024 defense won\'t come from outside the organization.\n\nThe return of All-Pro linebacker Matt Milano, who suffered a season-ending leg injury last year in Week 5 against the Jaguars, easily is the most important development at a position of strength for the Bills. Milano will join Terrel Bernard, last year\'s breakout star, in forming an imposing duo in the team\'s base defense.\n\nAnalytics website Pro Football Focus placed Milano at No. 4 on its list of top linebackers in the NFL entering the 2024 season despite his extended absence last year - a good indication of the respect that exists for his game.\n\nPeople are also reading...

"He\'s so focused. He was focused before this. I feel like he\'s even more focused, if that\'s even possible now, in wanting to get back out there for himself, but also for his teammates."\n\nBills linebacker Baylon Spector knows he must shake off \'injury prone\' label\n\nBaylon Spector knows all too well why the old saying "the best ability is availability" exists in the NFL. The Buffalo Bills\' linebacker endured a frustrating 2023 season, dealing with multiple injuries that resulted in him appearing in just nine regular-season games.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nThe Bills\' base defense is nickel, which means five defensive backs and two linebackers are on the field for most plays. Entering 2023, who would line up next to Milano was an open question. Bernard provided a resounding answer, putting together a fantastic season. Because of that, he enters 2024 with the expectation that he\'ll take a big step forward as both a player and leader.\n\n"Whether it\'s the player-to-coach relationship or the coach-to-player relationship, there\'s a sense of trust that has to be earned, right? The coach has to show a player that you can help them grow and help them succeed," Bills defensive coordinator Bobby Babich said. "And in turn, the player has to show that they can be trustworthy. We can give him the keys to the car and he\'s going to drive it, and it\'s going to be a smooth, smooth ride. And it grew."\n\nReturnees: Matt Milano, Terrell Bernard, Dorian Williams, Baylon Spector.\n\nNewcomers: Joe Andreessen, Nicholas Morrow, Deion Jones, Edefuan Ulofoshio.\n\nDepartures: A.J. Klein, Tyler Matakevich, Tyrel Dodson.\n\nTop battle: Jones vs. Morrow vs. Spector vs. Ulofoshio.\n\nBills position preview: Defensive tackle depth chart undergoes a makeover\n\nThe Buffalo Bills\' front office significantly rebuilt the interior of the team\'s defensive line this offseason.\n\nLet\'s go with a WWE-style, fatal-fourway matchup here. For this purpose, we\'re excluding Andreessen, who is considered a roster long shot. The Bills carried six linebackers on the 53-man roster. Working off that number, it\'s safe to assume Bernard, Milano and Williams, as a 2023 third-round pick, are safe. That leaves three spots for four players. A strong case can be made for each of them. Morrow made 12 starts and 95 tackles for Philadelphia last year. He\'s probably the first choice as Bernard\'s backup at middle linebacker. Spector is entering his third season in Buffalo, so he knows the defensive scheme well and is in line for a key job on special teams, perhaps as Matakevich\'s replacement. The Bills used a fifth-round pick on Ulofoshio and likely don\'t want to expose him to waivers. Jones, meanwhile, is another veteran option, with 91 career starts in eight NFL seasons. Barring an injury, there doesn\'t figure to be room for all of them.\n\nWhat to expect: If Milano and Bernard stay healthy, the Bills should have one of the best duos in the NFL at the position. It would be nice to see Williams take a big step in his second season. That way, the Bills can feel comfortable putting him on the field when they go to three-linebacker sets, or he can be the first backup to come into the game if Bernard and/or Milano miss time. It was clear last year that Williams has the athleticism to make an impact in the NFL, but the coaching staff was hesitant to play him, ultimately deciding on Dodson as Milano\'s long-term replacement. The additions of Morrow and Jones give the team two reliable veteran options. Spector needs to stay healthy. It\'s not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but missing mandatory minicamp with an undisclosed injury won\'t do anything to shake the idea that he\'s injury prone. Ulofoshio was a leader at Washington, which made it to the national championship game. He worked his way up from walk-on to team captain with the Huskies.

You tell me I\'m supposed to trust it, but I don\'t ... and I can\'t remember my app password anyway.\n\nStill, there\'s something about this year, 2024. Major League Baseball finally made pitchers and batters pick up the pace in 2023, and this season these National League Central-leading Brewers became ... intriguing. Everyone in the clubhouse talks about the super-low expectations, and we all know underdog journeys really are the best stories. It was time to face my anxiety - I don\'t know this game, I don\'t understand these intricacies - and see if I could return to baseball. And learn its peculiar language.\n\nMedia. Watch games, listen to broadcasts and podcasts, and read the coverage.\n\nAnd stats - because no other sport marries itself to data more than this one.\n\nA natural place to start was Gold Glove-winner, MVP and all-around good-attitude dude Christian Yelich.\n\nOK, one of the stat websites - baseball-reference.com - features 12 pages. Batting average, plate appearances, home runs, stolen bases, RBIs. It starts with the usual stuff, all makes sense.\n\nAnd then ... OBP, OPS and OPS plus. And ... player value batting.\n\nMy anxiety levels rise. This is clearly a foreign language. I reach out to Jeff Levering, the very kind, very knowledgeable Brewers radio broadcaster. He will help translate.\n\n"I\'ll have to study up, some of these stats are like programming a VCR," he responded via text, and that is funny in more ways than one.\n\nOK, in the meantime, we can always count on broadcasters Brian Anderson and Bill Schroeder. They were calling a Brewers-Boston Red Sox game on June 2 and discussing the batting percentage leaders in the National League when they posited the question: does Yelich have a chance at the NL batting title?\n\nAnderson: A player needs 3.2 at-bat plate appearances per team games to qualify for the batting title. Yelich missed some time mid-April ...\n\nAs I\'m doing a Google search - who is Dom, Brewers? - Anderson and Schroeder jump back to the topic. Their man Dom reports the number is actually 3.1, not 3.2 and ... what were we talking about anyway?\n\nHe rolls his gaze - just a little. It\'s four hours before another game in a summer of endless games and the 32-year-old veteran has likely heard every question that ever existed. God, it must get old. But these stats! They make for endless talking points and debates and Yelich is a newly inducted member of some elite 200 club - career home runs and steals. So Yelich must have a great take on all this; what stats are good, and what are a joke; and which ones are really telling, and which are helpful, and ...\n\n"I don\'t even look at my stats; I couldn\'t tell you a single one of my stats right now. I have zero idea. Like no clue," he said. "They don\'t matter to me until the end of the season because they change so much. So I don\'t look at them."\n\nOh. But ... in general, there must be some stat that\'s valuable?\n\n"Not really. People talk about them - the media and the fans. I don\'t know. Players, like - we don\'t really care."\n\nAwkward silence. It\'s not a slammed door on this story idea but wow, if he doesn\'t care, should we? My anxiety alarms are blaring. This is the MVP who has come to Bucks games to watch the other MVP in town. This is a respected guy in Milwaukee. And he\'s killing this stat story project before its even started. Is he serious? One last weak attempt: BABIP? Does he care about that? Does he care about anything?\n\nBut it makes sense. When someone like Yelich works and trains and plays like he does, what purpose would it serve to look at numbers and trends?\n\n"I don\'t know why you\'d want to put yourself through looking at your stuff like every day," Yelich said. "I care about winning and trying to help the team win."\n\nIt means there\'s room for the rest of us to try to decode the numerical quirks and statistical quarks of the game without the pressure of trying to fake like we know it.\n\nLet\'s head out to the yard. Hey, at least baseball is an inviting sport to the spectator, unlike the dizzying flurry of football and frenetic pace of basketball. Baseball is polite, letting you gather your flock, find your spot and settle in to take in the weather, the people around you and the smell of the roasting hot dogs before you have to be alert.

If your AeroPress keeps you caffeinated in the morning, no need to splurge on a big old espresso machine. And if your personal blender suits your needs, a Vitamix might not be necessary. (Though it is on sale!) But if there\'s one thing many of us can\'t get enough of -- especially during the summer -- it\'s ice. And if your fridge\'s ice maker isn\'t cutting it -- let alone if it doesn\'t even have one -- GE\'s Profile Opal 2.0 is the viral-phenom, top-shelf solution you need. And it\'s on mega-sale for Amazon Prime Day -- that\'s our idea of a guilt-free splurge.\n\nMany a TikToker has declared their love of this high-tech contraption, which produces irresistibly chewy nugget-style ice (or, "fancy ice," as one reviewer called it). Needless to say, it\'s a hot-ticket item, which is why we\'re super excited to see it marked down.\n\n(While we\'re on the subject of saving, we Yahoo shopping editors have been working around the clock to bring you the very best Prime Day deals. We\'re comparing prices, checking sale histories, the whole shebang, because the last thing you want to do is spend your precious time weeding out all of the "meh" discounts to find the worthwhile ones. Oh, and if you\'re particularly interested in more Prime Day kitchen deals, yours truly -- a former professional baker -- found some really good picks.)\n\nYou\'re saving $200 with this Prime Day sale, which brings this sought-after appliance down to its best price of the year -- and very close to its lowest price of all time (our trackers tell us it was briefly $449 back in December). If your household goes through a lot of ice, this will save you a ton of time and headache, which is pretty priceless!\n\nThose of us without ice-making refrigerators usually have to rely on those flimsy trays that never seem to want to release the cubes and take a long time to freeze. A countertop ice maker, on the other hand, lets you have ice on demand, and the GE Opal is super speedy.\n\nHow speedy? Well, it can crank out 1.6 pounds per hour, or 38 pounds per day, according to the manufacturer. Plus, it can hold up to 3 pounds of ice at a time. That\'s a lot of really iced tea!\n\nAs mentioned, the ice itself is of the nugget variety, which many of us enjoy crunching on at restaurants but rarely have access to at home. To get your freeze on, you\'ll just fill the attached reservoir with water (it\'s quite large, so you won\'t have to refill very often). From there, just hit the power button and you\'re in business. Oh, and any melted water gets delivered back to the reservoir to help keep the ice from forming large clumps.\n\nAs I said, this machine is pretty high-tech, but not in an intimidating way. Reviewers say the SmartHQ app, which can be used to schedule ice production, is user-friendly, and you can even pair it with Alexa and Google if you want to operate it via voice control.\n\nThis ice device has melted many an Amazon customer\'s heart.\n\n"Absolutely love this little machine!" exclaimed one shopper. "Big fan of chewy ice, and after only enjoying it from the few restaurants and convenience stores that sell drinks with it, I finally have delicious chewy ice at home. Easy setup, and [I] quickly have enough ice to satisfy my family."\n\n"I am really enjoying this icemaker," shared another. "I live alone, had a full refrigerator with no freezer inside my house and had to go to the garage to get ice. This little icemaker is a workhorse, and the ice is wonderful. It stays frozen, you can chew it, it\'s like restaurant ice. It makes a ton. I was scared of the cleaning, but it didn\'t have any trouble whatsoever; [it] was quick and easy."\n\n"The smart app is amazing," raved a third. "I travel, and like the fact that I\'m able to create a schedule and turn the ice maker on/off through the app. It was very easy to set up and it\'s also easy to maintain."\n\nOne common complaint? The noise. "I love this device for the ice," shared one user. "But it\'s the loudest machine I have owned. I find myself from time to time just powering it off so I don\'t have to hear it for a bit. Great ice, though!"\n\n"It is a tad noisy," agreed a final fan, "but well worth the return." They added, "This is one of my greatest purchases. Makes every beverage with ice better. ...

So we got to be creative with it," Nelson said.\n\nFor anyone looking to venture into a side-hustle, Nelson recommended a "good ol\' brain dump."\n\n"Get all of your ideas into a list. Any ideas you\'ve ever had," she said. "What are you really good at? What do you enjoy doing?

A 31-22 road loss to Georgia Tech dropped the Orange to 5-6 and ultimately led to Babers' dismissal after eight seasons.\n\nNunzio Campanile, in an interim role, led Syracuse to a four-point win over Wake Forest in the regular-season finale to secure the Orange's second consecutive bowl berth and an opportunity to play for a winning record in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 2012-13.\n\nThe Boca Raton Bowl didn't fare well for a Syracuse team that was without starting quarterback Garrett Shrader. South Florida held the Orange to 159 yards of total offense in a 45-0 win that spoiled Campanile's two games as interim coach.\n\nSyracuse, which will host Virginia Tech on Nov. 2, hired Fran Brown as head coach to turn around the program. Brown, who spent two seasons as defensive backs coach at Georgia and was known for his recruiting prowess, helped bring in plenty of transfers to fill voids in the Orange roster and currently has one of the nation's top recruiting classes in the 2025 cycle.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The nonconference slate also features a road game against UNLV and a home game against UConn.\n\nThe Orange will play two of the ACC's three new members. They will travel to play at California on Nov. 16.\n\nLast time vs. Virginia Tech: Virginia Tech won 38-10 on Oct. 26, 2023\n\nWhat happened? Malachi Thomas' touchdown pass to Da'Quan Felton was one of the trick plays Tyler Bowen called in the Hokies' blowout win over the Orange on that Thursday night.\n\nTech racked up 528 yards of total offense. Most of that yardage came on the ground as the Hokies rushed for 318 yards, led by 118 from Bhayshul Tuten and 87 from Thomas. Kyron Drones threw for 194 yards and a touchdown as the Hokies moved the ball at will against the beleaguered visitors.\n\nPosition(s) of strength: Syracuse landed one of the top quarterbacks in the transfer portal when Ohio State's Kyle McCord elected to join the ACC program. McCord was coming off his first season as a starter with the Buckeyes and led them to an 11-1 record when he entered the portal.\n\nMcCord instantly upgraded Syracuse's quarterback room. He threw for 3,170 yards, 24 touchdowns and six interceptions last season, and he had more than 200 yards passing in 11 of the 12 games.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nMcCord joined an offense that returns six of the seven offensive linemen who started multiple games last season. (Left guard Chris Bleich, an All-ACC honorable mention selection, is the only one who isn't back.) Leading rusher LeQuint Allen (1,064 yards and nine touchdowns) is returning, along with the Nos. 2 and 3 receivers (Umari Hatcher and Donovan Brown) and top tight end Dan Villari.\n\nThe Orange lost top receiver Damien Alford (33 catches for 610 yards and three touchdowns) to Utah, but replaced him with Colorado State's Justus Ross-Simmons (45 catches for 724 yards and three scores).\n\nWhat's new in Syracuse: Brown's arrival meant a shake-up in the coaching staff. The first-time head coach elected to fill his staff with experience across the board.\n\nTwo coaches who were in the NFL in 2023 (Jeff Nixon with the New York Giants and Ross Douglas with the New England Patriots) are overseeing the running backs and wide receivers, respectively. Elijah Robinson (assistant head coach and defensive coordinator) and Joe Schaefer (defensive backs) were at Texas A&M last season. Robert Wright, the co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach, was most recently the defensive coordinator at Mid-American Conference program Buffalo.\n\nDale and Nick Williams (not related) both had previous coaching experience at the Power Four level. Dale Williams previously worked at Louisville and Purdue, while Nick Williams had stops at Colorado, Texas A&M and Georgia.\n\nBrown retained only two members from the 2023 staff. Campanile is the offensive associate head coach and quarterbacks coach, and Michael Johnson remained on staff as the co-offensive coordinator and tight ends coach.\n\nThe Orange did have roster turnover with the coaching change. Twenty-eight players elected to enter the transfer portal, while Brown was able to bring in 19 players through the portal.\n\nLingering questions: The Orange actually finished with decent numbers on defense despite some lopsided outcomes. (Four of their seven losses were by at least 28 points.) They ranked midpack in the ACC in rushing and total defense and were decent at getting to the quarterback.\n\nLinebacker Marlowe Wax was instrumental in making sure his teammates were in the right spot, and he is back for another season guiding the unit. However, there aren't as many familiar faces surrounding him.\n\nSyracuse returns four players who started every game last season (Wax, linebacker Derek McDonald, boundary safety Alijah Clark and rover Justin Barron). Defensive tackle Denis Jaquez Jr. started the first three games at defensive tackle before suffering a season-ending injury in the sixth week.\n\nHow will the defense shape up with a new scheme and different faces?\n\nThe Orange's additions through the transfer portal focused on the defensive line and secondary. Four players from each position group were brought in to add depth and battle for starting roles. Wright, the former defensive coordinator at Buffalo, brough safety Devin Grant to Syracuse. Grant led the MAC with five interceptions, which was highlighted by returning two of his three interceptions for touchdowns against Central Michigan.\n\nCornerback Clarence Lewis made 23 starts over four seasons at Notre Dame. Defensive lineman Dion Wilson Jr. recorded 30 tackles last season for New Mexico State.\n\nDamien Sordelett (540) 981-3124\n\ndamien.sordelett@roanoke.com\n\nVTFB gamebug\n\nVIRGINIA TECH AT VANDERBILT\n\nSeason opener\n\nAug. 31: Noon TV: ESPN", 'source': {'uri': 'richmond.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Richmond Times-Dispatch'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@richmond.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/94/b945f512-400f-562e-862e-57a282361d22/6687499787908.preview.jpg?crop=1755%2C921%2C4%2C54&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 458817436, 'relevance': 51}

Scoring is 5-4-3-2-1 for the first five places.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"The races will be fast, they\'re all sprints," said Ocean City Beach Patrol Deputy Chief Holly Lesser. "The races are near the shore."\n\nLast year was the first time the Invitational was held at 12th Street rather than farther south on the island where there\'s no Boardwalk.\n\nPeople are also reading...

"We\'ve shortened up all the events to make them spectator friendly. We\'ll get a bigger crowd. We\'ve already been announcing it on the Boardwalk speakers all week just to get people excited about it and pumped up ready to come watch. The crowd downtown will definitely be more inclusive, and it\'s a fun event."\n\nThe first race, the row-swim, starts out like a doubles row. But at the halfway flag, one guard from each crew jumps out and swims back to the finish line on the beach. In the swim relay, one guard swims out and back, and her teammate will then do the same.\n\nThe third race, the paddle relay, also has two lifeguards teaming up. The run-swim relay starts with one guard doing a half-mile beach run. She tags a teammate who swims out to a flag and back.\n\nSea Girt was first in the run-swim in 2023 and scored 14 points to win the overall team title. Longport was second with 12 points, and Ocean City placed third with 11.\n\nContact Guy Gargan:\n\n609-272-7210\n\nGGargan@pressofac.com\n\nCan\'t get enough High School sports?

He plans to have it available for the rest of the government this year.\n\nThe program was developed by a generative AI research and development center led by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in collaboration with several other universities.\n\nSun said the model would provide functions like graphics and video design in the future. To what degree it would compare to the capabilities of ChatGPT was unclear.\n\nSun\'s bureau did not respond to The Associated Press\' questions about the model\'s functions.\n\nSun said on the radio show that industry players and the government would play a role in the model\'s future development.\n\n"Given Hong Kong\'s current situation, it\'s difficult for Hong Kong to get giant companies like Microsoft and Google to subsidize such projects, so the government had to start doing it," he said.\n\nBeijing and Washington are locked in a race for AI supremacy, with China having ambitions to become the global leader in AI by 2030.\n\nChina, including Hong Kong and neighboring Macao, is not on the list of "supported countries and territories" of OpenAI, one of the best-known artificial intelligence companies.\n\nThe ChatGPT maker has not explained why certain territories were excluded but said accounts in those places attempting to access its services may become blocked.\n\nAccording to a post on OpenAI\'s online forum and local media reports, the company announced in an email to some users that it would be taking additional measures to block connections from regions not on the approved list starting July 9. It did not explain the reasons behind the latest move.\n\nFrancis Fong, the honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, said it was hard to say whether the capabilities of the program in Hong Kong could match those of ChatGPT. With the input of AI companies in the city, Fong said he believed it could technologically catch up with the standards.\n\n"Will it become the top? Maybe may not necessarily be as close as that. But I believe it won\'t be too far behind," he said.\n\nHe also said a locally developed AI program might more accurately address local language and localized issues but adding it would "make sense" if the final product appears to be "politically correct."\n\nLike most foreign websites and applications, ChatGPT is technically unavailable in China because of the country\'s firewall, which censors the internet for residents. Determined individuals can still gain access via commonly available "virtual private networks" that bypass restrictions.\n\nChinese tech giants such as Alibaba and Baidu have already rolled out primarily Chinese-language AI models similar to ChatGPT for public and commercial use. However, these AI models must abide by China\'s censorship rules.\n\nIn May, China\'s cyberspace academy said an AI chatbot was being trained on President Xi Jinping\'s doctrine, a stark reminder of the ideological parameters within which Chinese AI models will operate.\n\nAlso in May, SenseTime, a major Chinese artificial intelligence company, launched SenseChat for users in Hong Kong, where most of the population speaks Cantonese as their mother tongue rather than Mandarin. But a check on Tuesday found the application could not provide answers to politically sensitive questions, such as what the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 and Hong Kong\'s protests in 2019 were about.\n\nDuring the 1989 crackdown, Chinese troops opened fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, dead, and that remains a taboo subject in mainland China.\n\nIn 2019, protests that started over unpopular Hong Kong legislation morphed into an anti-government movement and the greatest political challenge to Beijing\'s rule since the former British colony returned to China in 1997.', 'source': {'uri': 'asahi.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': '朝日新聞デジタル'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'asahi_shimbun@asahi.com', 'name': 'Asahi Shimbun', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'japan@asahi.com', 'name': 'Japan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'china@asahi.com', 'name': 'China', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://p.potaufeu.asahi.com/70df-p/picture/28655118/c775271f17e2e9b9708e0a6024ea6f95.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.003921568627450966, 'wgt': 458816617, 'relevance': 31}

These little guys will chew on wood all day, providing players with a constant supply of useful Logs for no effort at all. With a couple of beavers at your base, you'll never have to chop another tree down again.\n\nIf you're planning on stocking up on tons of charcoal in Once Human, then a Logging Beaver is going to be a great help. Getting one of these is going to involve more luck than skill, however. Thankfully, there's a very useful trick that will let you refresh your game in hopes of finding a beaver before anyone else does.\n\n3:04\n\nRelated\n\nOnce Human: Gaia Cliff Monolith Exploration Guide (Elite Enemy, Mystical, Weapon, and Armor Crate Locations)\n\nThis guide will help player complete Settlement Exploration - Gaia Cliff Monolith Danger Zone, an optional quest in Once Human.\n\nHow To Get Logging Beavers In Once Human\n\nThe best way to get a Logging Beaver is to go to Meyer's Market in the Broken Delta. The main quest will tell you to go here as soon as you wrap things up around Deadsville. Once you arrive in the town, activate the nearby teleporter tower, then head south to the pier. If you're lucky, you should be able to see a Logging Beaver bubble floating around. Approach it, then press F to start the capturing process.\n\nIf there is no Logging Beaver at the pier, you can force your way into a different instance by changing worlds in Once Human. Head back to the teleporter tower, then press G. A menu listing all the worlds in your server will appear. Go through each of them while checking the pier if there's a Logging Beaver available, and keep repeating the process until you manage to catch one. If none of the worlds have a Logging Beaver, come back some other time.\n\nHow To Use Logging Beavers\n\nBefore your beavers can begin providing logs, you'll need to make an Isolated Securement Unit for them first. You can find it under the Facility tab of the Build menu, provided you've unlocked its associated node in the Memetics screen. Place the Isolated Securement Unit anywhere on your base, then deposit your Logging Beaver inside it. The beaver will automatically start logging whenever it has enough energy to do so, and you can claim all the Logs it got by interacting with its Securement Unit again.\n\nWith the Beaver inside its own securement unit, you can now modify its behavior to an extent. By default, the Logging Beaver will set out for wood every time its Deviant Power reaches or surpasses 30. If you interact with the Isolated Securement Unit and click on the small gear icon on the right side of the screen, you can change the Deviant Power Threshold, affecting the time your beaver spends working and resting.\n\nSetting the Deviant Power threshold to a higher number means your base deviants will work longer shifts, but they'll also rest for longer too. This shouldn't affect your overall gains too much, but you may want to switch this up depending if you're playing on the Manibus or Evolution's Call servers. If you need to squeeze out as many resources as you can, then keep the threshold as-is.\n\nOnce Human\n\nSystem PC , Mobile , Google , Apple\n\nPlatform(s) PC , Android , iOS\n\nReleased July 9, 2024\n\nPublisher(s) Starry Studio , NetEase, Inc.\n\nGenre(s) Survival , Shooter , Open-World\n\nOnce Human\n\nSystem PC , Mobile , Google , Apple\n\nPlatform(s) PC , Android , iOS\n\nReleased July 9, 2024\n\nPublisher(s) Starry Studio , NetEase, Inc.\n\nGenre(s) Survival , Shooter , Open-World", 'source': {'uri': 'gamerant.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Game Rant'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'marc_santos@gamerant.com', 'name': 'Marc Santos', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716141706_1.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.192156862745098, 'wgt': 458816274, 'relevance': 5}

There is a lot of scientific evidence that we tend to select the most confident among us as leaders, not the most competent. Claiming to know everything can get you pretty far.\n\nBut according to both Branson and Sinek, it won\'t get you as far as admitting when you don\'t know something and asking for help without shame or apology. Just being willing to say "I don\'t know" can be a leadership superpower.\n\nBranson gives two reasons for this in his LinkedIn post: "It encourages others to do the same, and it\'s the fastest way to learn!" Both are backed up by iconic leaders and considerable science.\n\nA decade or so ago, Google devoted years to trying to figure out what made certain teams wildly successful and others mediocre. You may have read about their startlingly simple conclusion, which has received a huge amount of media attention in the years since. Great teams, Google discovered, didn\'t have the smartest individual members or a particular mix of skills or backgrounds. They had "psychological safety."\n\nAs Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson explained in a classic 1999 study, psychological safety means a "shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking" and "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up."\n\nIn short, psychological safety means feeling safe to admit your ignorance, try things, mess up, and learn from mistakes. All without punishment or ridicule. How is it established? In lots of small ways, but one of the most important is by having leaders who model psychological safety by being willing to admit "I don\'t know."\n\nSo when Branson says that asking for help "encourages others to do the same," he\'s drawing on some of the most respected research on how truly great teams function.\n\nAnd how about Branson\'s other claim, that admitting your ignorance and asking for help is one of the fastest ways to learn? Turns out that too is backed by a mountain of research, as well as some of Branson\'s fellow moguls.\n\nIntellectual humility is the ability to admit you might be wrong and look for new information or other possibilities. Studies show it helps people understand other viewpoints, be more curious, and evaluate evidence. Admitting your shortcomings and asking for help and advice even makes you appear more intelligent, science shows. In short, confidently saying, "I don\'t know," as Branson observes, helps you learn faster and be smarter.\n\nWhich might be why intellectual luminaries from Wharton\'s Adam Grant to Harvard\'s Steven Pinker have all suggested that if you want to be more successful, a good place to start is greater intellectual humility. Jeff Bezos says it\'s one of the top qualities he looks for when hiring.\n\nAll of which is a long-winded way to say that, yes, confidence will get you pretty far as a leader. But for true greatness, you need to combine conviction with a keen understanding of your limitations and a willingness to freely admit what you don\'t know. Good leaders have vision. Great leaders have vision plus humility.', 'source': {'uri': 'inc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Inc.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jessica_stillman@inc.com', 'name': 'Jessica Stillman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/richard-branson_542593_fd0pxj.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.4431372549019608, 'wgt': 458811159, 'relevance': 78}

Overweight, inverted nipples, and wearing a T-shirt two sizes too big. My soon-to-be personal trainer enters the consultation room.\n\nWe hit the weights hard. We sort my nutrition, though all I\'m really hungry for are the veins pouring down his forearms. We never discuss how "massive" and "healthy" are not the same thing. Nor that gay men and bodybuilders are two of the highest risk groups for developing Muscle Dysmorphia.\n\nMy training continues more or less into uni, by which time my eyes have absorbed a lethal dose of "inspiration" (#bearmode #yoked #fitnessmodel). The resulting tumour is malignant, shaped like Mr Olympia, and metastasising in my optic nerve. I can no longer see the sex appeal of normal bodies.\n\nThe homogenous hotties of the Sydney gay scene don\'t help. It seems to me the ticket to any one of their yacht parties is a six-pack. I\'m sure what\'s left of my belly is inadmissible. The Daily Jocks speedo I try on agrees.\n\nI Google \'Trenbolone\' for the second time. I am scared. Scared because this time, the long list of side-effects, "neurotoxicity" and "advanced brain ageing" among them, doesn\'t scare me.\n\nBut this pull. This gravity I\'m feeling. It isn\'t just the product of toxic beauty standards or wanting to fit in; it\'s limbic. A lust I feel in my own body.\n\nUnlike the cis straight man, I experience homoeroticism. I don\'t just want my dream body. I\'m attracted to it. While the cis straight man sexualises women, an ontological other, I sexualise men, the grouping I belong to. So when platforms like Grindr, Instagram, and Twitter routinely reduce men into sexual objects, I learn to reduce myself.\n\n"I wish my pecs bulged out like his", "I wish I had his v-line", "Why can\'t my calves look like that?". I learn another man\'s sex appeal is just a deficit in myself. And it only takes a sideward glance by the dumbbells to see I\'m not alone.\n\nBut it isn\'t all bad. Sometimes I enjoy being a sexual object. Especially when I get to appreciate a fat pump in the mirror - or better yet - when it scores me a lingering glance in the changerooms. So I keep lifting.\n\nBy 24, I am 100 kilos and only 11 per cent body fat. Straight girls at the club start calling me superman. Circuit parties are a sea of men staring at the veins pouring down my forearms.\n\nBut still I\'m not muscular enough. Still, my reflection in the heat-smogged bathroom mirror is a checklist of "to-dos".\n\nBut resistance training is much easier than training to resist.\n\nSo I tell myself it\'s okay to want to look "fit". I constantly reiterate the enormous health benefits of weightlifting. Endorphins this and discipline that. I insist bodybuilding isn\'t just about aesthetics; it\'s a sport.\n\nI spin eloquent meta-narratives about the beauty of the process, about pushing oneself, about progress, endurance, and hitting new performance limits. I am persuasive.\n\nBut then I ask myself what came first: the lifting, or this legitimation? Are these neatly woven reasons really why I train? Or are they true because I need them to be? Because if I can\'t convince myself I gym for healthy, normative reasons, I\'ll be forced to stop altogether?\n\nRight now, I\'m dating a boy who, like me, wants to get massive. And, like me, he already is. The hairs below his jawline grow in in a little spiral pattern, and yet he squirms when I stare at him like a Van Gogh. He is articulate and contrarian, but regularly returns the day after a debate with a changed mind.\n\nThe two pillars of muscle running down his lower back seem shaped for my hands to hold (not to mention where they lead).\n\nWhen this boy glances past the cables at some grunting mass and tells me he wishes he were bigger, I am stupefied. I want to shake him.\n\n"You are overwhelming," I want to say. Just looking at him floods me with so much awe that it tickles my sinuses. And yet, even this boy can look at himself and see inadequacy.\n\nBut what makes me the most angry is I\'m in no position to correct him. My biceps, swollen as he says these things, are themselves an endorsement of the mindset we share. Bigger, bigger, but never big enough.\n\nI wish he had never stepped foot in the gym.\n\nIt is at this moment I realise I am no longer comfortable being an apologist for resistance training. It\'s time to answer the question I\'ve lobbed excuse after excuse at, but that, really, I\'m afraid to approach with a ten-foot pole.\n\nI go to the gym because I want a fuckable reflection. Because I enjoy the countless benefits of \'pretty privilege\'. Because I\'ve spent a decade internalising warped standards of male beauty. Because I want muscular men I don\'t know or care for to look me up and down like a piece of meat. Because, due to the wonders of homoeroticism, I can\'t decide if these are men I want to befriend, bed, or be.\n\nA confession from inside the cult of dysmorphia. Wouldn\'t that be an easy place to finish this article.\n\nUnfortunately, resistance training has done me immense good too.\n\nFor one, the food-loving kid inside me can finally eat seven meals a day and not hate himself for it. The meniscus tear in my knee is no longer a source of instability or pain, and I have an understanding of physical health and nutrition that I never would\'ve sought out otherwise.\n\nAnd, as much as I hate to say it, I do enjoy the process (\'endorphins\' this, and \'discipline\' that). I\'m even finally proud of my body (at least, most of the time).\n\nBut does that make it right to parade my musculature around as a monument to resistance training? All while knowing the dissatisfaction, obsession, and superficiality that went into building it? All while knowing some kid might find himself looking at the veins pouring down my forearms, and decide he wants to be a monument too?\n\nGym and I haven\'t broken up. As with any tumultuous long-term relationship, I\'m hoping there\'s a balance to be found. Though I wish the boy I\'m dating had never met gym, the two are well-acquainted now, and I imagine our little dysmorphic throuple will go on for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut it isn\'t all doom and dysmorphia.\n\nI do know one thing: taking a step back and examining my drives has allowed me to reclaim some autonomy. It has allowed me to invest a bit more into the parts of me that will actually outlive my remaining ten years of beauty.', 'source': {'uri': 'starobserver.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Star Observer'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.starobserver.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JacquesImageJakeWeiszV2.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 458808314, 'relevance': 56}

The Himalayan-based roadster is scheduled to break covers on July 17 in Barcelona, Spain. Ahead of its debut tomorrow, the Chennai-based bikemaker is actively promoting the upcoming 450cc roadster on its social media handles.\n\nIn one of the recent teasers, the Guerilla 450 can be seen burning its tyres which in a way highlights the bike's sporty and street nature. The rear wheel gets shod with dual-purpose rubbers with thick sidewalls. In another teaser, the video shows glimpses of the city Barcelona where the Guerilla 450 is going to be unveiled.\n\nRoyal Enfield Guerilla 450: Styling\n\nRecently, the 450cc roadster was spotted in a dealership service station most likely for a quick service training for technicians or a pre-delivery inspection. We already know that Royal Enfield will offer the Guerilla 450 in single-tone as well dual-tone colour options including matte grey, red and black, and yellow and black.\n\nVisual highlights on Guerilla 450 include a chiselled yet muscular fuel tank, a floating tail section, a single-piece seat, split grab rails, an underbelly bash plate, and a stubby exhaust muffler, just like the one seen in Himalayan 450. Signature Royal Enfield elements like a round headlamp, an off-set circular instrument console, and round rear view mirrors have been carried over to the Guerilla.\n\nRoyal Enfield Guerilla 450: Features\n\nThe top-of-the-line Guerilla 450 will boast a feature-packed instrument cluster. This fully-digital display integrates Google Maps navigation, Bluetooth connectivity for calls, texts, music, and even lets you switch between ride modes. Lower trims get a simpler semi-digital setup similar to the Meteor 350 and Super Meteor 650. These might offer Tripper Navigation as an optional add-on.\n\nExpect all variants to come with LED headlights and turn signals, multiple ride mode options, and a USB charging port for your convenience.\n\nRoyal Enfield Guerilla 450: Mechanical specs\n\nTaking a closer look at leaked images, the Guerilla 450 sports a compact profile thanks to its 17-inch alloy wheels front and back. These wheels are wrapped in block-pattern tires, hinting at some off-road capability. The suspension setup appears to be telescopic forks upfront and a preload-adjustable monoshock at the rear, providing a balance of comfort and handling. Disc brakes on both wheels will ensure confident stopping power.\n\nUnder the frame, the Guerilla 450 borrows the same 450cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine from its sibling, the Himalayan 450. While the Himalayan produces 39 bhp and 40 Nm of torque, the Guerilla's engine tuning might be tweaked for a more road-focused character. Both bikes likely share a 6-speed gearbox with a slipper clutch for smoother gear changes.", 'source': {'uri': 'financialexpress.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Financial Express'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'express_drives_desk@financialexpress.com', 'name': 'Express Drives Desk', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Royal-Enfield-Guerilla-450.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 458805686, 'relevance': 3}

There is also a main story that helps players progress through the world and activate the various Rift Anchors to open the pathway to bosses.\n\nAs players get further into the game and want to join up with allies and partake in PVP, they can join a Warband. Warbands are like clans in Once Human and also offer players unique things to do as various Warbands fight for resources.\n\nRelated\n\nOnce Human: How To Upgrade Weapons\n\nUpgrading weapons in Once Human is simple, but if you don\'t quite have the resources for a big upgrade, there are other ways to get stronger.\n\nHow To Create Or Join A Warband\n\nClose\n\nPlayers can create a Warband by going to the main menu, selecting the, "Get United" option, then selecting, "Warband". A list of existing Warbands in your current world will be displayed along the left side of the screen, with players also able to change worlds in order to get access to different Warbands if they would prefer different options.\n\nSome Warbands require applications, and sending them is as easy as selecting the Warband you want to join and press the, "Join Warband" button in the bottom right of the screen. Next to this button is the option to create a Warband, with players able to customize the name, logo, slogan, and restrictions to join. Creating a Warband makes you the leader, but it also costs 800 Energy Links. Joining a Warband, on the other hand, is free, with players able to join and leave as many Warbands as they want.\n\nRelated\n\nOnce Human: Beginner Mistakes To Avoid\n\nOnce Human is a complex game with a steep learning curve, so make sure you don\'t make these simple mistakes.\n\nBasics Of A Warband\n\nClose\n\nWarbands are the Once Human version of clans. Joining a Warband gives you allies that you can play together with while doing the basic activities in the game. As Warbands get stronger, they are able to take and hold territory to gather resources for all players in the Warband, while also declaring war with other Warbands to take territory.\n\nUpon first joining a Warband, players will get access to the Warband menu, found in the same place players went when trying to join a Warband. In this menu, basic members will be given a few things they can do:\n\nName\n\nExplanation\n\nDonate\n\nIn the Overview menu will be the "Donate Warband Fund" option in the bottom left. Players can donate ten items weekly to earn Warband Credits.\n\nCheck Members\n\nThe members menu lets players see the profiles of all members in the Warband, their ranking in the Warband, and whether they are online or not. This menu also gives players the ability to leave the Warband by holding, "Z".\n\nShop\n\nPlayers can trade their Warband Credits and Stardust Source for various items, with many refreshing weekly.\n\nThere are a few other things that can be done in a Warband, such as taking territory or declaring war, but this is only done by the leader.\n\nOnce Human\n\nSystem PC , Mobile , Google , Apple\n\nPlatform(s) PC , Android , iOS\n\nReleased July 9, 2024\n\nDeveloper(s) Starry Studio\n\nPublisher(s) Starry Studio , NetEase, Inc.', 'source': {'uri': 'gamerant.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Game Rant'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'joshua_leeds@gamerant.com', 'name': 'Joshua Leeds', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fes-30.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.3960784313725489, 'wgt': 458804699, 'relevance': 7}

After another postponement, the event was finally completed, this time in perfect weather.\n\nAvalon\'s Gary Nagle and Dave Giulian started off the show by winning the doubles row for the third year in a row. Becca Cubbler won the women\'s swim for the patrol, and Avalon\'s Ryan Finnegan won the singles row for the second straight year.\n\nAfter winning no races last Monday, Avalon came on to win with 29 points.

Close behind was Sea Isle\'s Danny Rogers, who started riding a wave but was turned sideways. Rogers recovered to get second, and Cape May Point\'s Ben Swan was third.\n\n"It was a little more challenging (being the defending champion), just because I knew people would be looking out for me this year," said Finnegan, a 24-year-old Rowan University graduate.

Nagle and Giulian won by three boat-lengths, and Sea Isle\'s Rogers and Pat Scannapieco were second. Third was Upper Township\'s Jimmy Nilson and James Garoh.\n\n"It (the ocean) was very smooth. We had a long, smooth stroke," said Nagle, the bow and a 24-year-old former Ursinus College wrestler and track and field athlete. "We had no problems tonight; it was a beautiful night."\n\nGiulian said he didn\'t know who was leading at the halfway flags in the ocean.\n\n"But once we turn that flag, we got to turn it up," said Giulian, a 20-year-old rising junior wrestler and footbball player at The College of New Jersey. "We\'re feeling good in the second half of the race always, so that\'s where we know we turn it up and finish strong."\n\nSanter sprinted at the end of the women\'s box paddleboard race to win by about 20 yards. The race had a box course, with a beach run at the beginning and end.\n\n"I think the run worked well for me, but I don\'t like it," said Santer, a 27-year-old former Duquesne University swimmer. "It definitely adds another challenge to the race. By the time you get to the board, you\'re out of breath, so it\'s not just paddling. It adds a whole another thing. And once you get out of the water, you still got to run.\n\nCubbler won the women\'s box swim, with O.C.\'s Summer DeWitt second and Sea Isle\'s Mary Kate Leonard third.\n\n"The swim (part of the race) was about a half(-mile), maybe a little longer," said Cubbler, a 26-year-old former Bloomsburg University swimmer. "It was good. The water\'s a little chilly, but I actually like it a little bit colder to race in."\n\nTaylor won the open box swim and then sat on the ground exhausted.\n\n"Both (the run and the swim) are tiresome," said Taylor, a 22-year-old recent graduate of the University of Delaware. "You run to the first buoy, it\'s basically a sprint, and you got to switch back into distance (swimming) mode till you finish the whole thing. Getting out and finishing with the longest leg of the run is kind of a killer, especially for us swimmers. We\'re not used to running so much."\n\nContact Guy Gargan: 609-272-7210\n\nGGargan@pressofac.com\n\nCan\'t get enough High School sports?

"I\'ve met and raced with a lot of people and made lasting friendships."\n\nThe fun run began in 1993.\n\n"I never got in karting or Late Models," Austin said. "I enjoyed running go karts in places like Pigeon Forge, and things kind of went from there."\n\nThe NASCAR touring scene was not on Austin\'s radar.\n\nPeople are also reading...

"Years ago, I did think about getting in a Late Model but that takes money."\n\nThe racing connection goes deep in the Austin family. Brother Doug Austin has competed many times against Rob in the Street Stock class at Kingsport and Coeburn.\n\nDoug has raced for nearly 20 years.\n\nIs it hard to compete against your brother?\n\n"No, it\'s fun," Rob said. "I just treat Doug like anybody else and we talk about racing together all the time in the garage.\n\n"I run Doug hard and he races me the same way. We\'ve never had an incident where we lost our tempers at each other."\n\nRob and Doug also discuss racing during breaks from their maintenance jobs at Oldcastle rock quarry in Castlewood.\n\n"Doug and I actually work together," Ron said. "We usually take care of our own cars unless something big comes up. I do the motor work, but we all jump in if we tear a car up."\n\nThe most impressive part of Austin\'s racecraft is his uncanny ability to control his car while battling side-by-side with a competitor for multiple laps.\n\nIt takes guts for a driver to simply make a car stick on the outside lane of a track. A master of car control, Rob often executes passes on the outside.\n\n"I can remember running side-by-side with Roger Neece (Trammel, Va.) for an entire race," Austin said. "As long as I don\'t mess up and the driver next to me doesn\'t mess up, that makes for good racing for the fans. I go to put on a show every week."\n\nRob, who finished third in last Friday\'s event at Kingsport, embraces the challenge of competing at any track.\n\n"I still have the car control, but I don\'t take the chances that I did when I started racing," Austin said. "The racing at Kingsport is a lot closer. If you get together with another car, you are likely to tear something up.\n\n"At Coeburn, you have room to catch your car or at least slow down before you hit something."\n\nAustin said he\'s also competed at Orange Couty Speedway in Durham, North Carolina, Franklin Count Speedway in Callaway, Virginia, and Newport Speedway in Newport, Tennessee.\n\n"We\'ve even ran two Street Stock races at Bristol Motor Speedway with Doug, Duke Bare, Jeff Counts (Castlewood) and several other local racers in 2011," Austin said. "Duke and Jeff both won at Bristol. That whole deal was different and lots of fun."\n\nEvery serious racer dreams of running at least one race, or even one lap, at Bristol.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\n"The Bristol track kind of sucks you down in the seat, and it\'s actually not as hard as some of these short tracks where you feel like you\'re getting thrown out of the car," Austin said.\n\nAustin has a total of eight wins between Kingsport and Coeburn this season.\n\nHow much longer will Rob continue adding to his trophy collection?\n\n"I don\'t really know. I still enjoy racing and still run full-time at Kingsport and Coeburn," Austin said. "I stay in shape by working and staying active. My mom (Bertha) comes to every race at age 81, and we all have a good time together as a family.\n\n"I never thought I would win 200 races when I started and I never worried about making it to NASCAR. I just did it for the fun, and we\'re still having fun."\n\nBRISTOL DRAGWAY: NHRA officials announced last week that the Super Grip NHRA Thunder Valley Nationals will return to its traditional weekend of June 6-8 on the 2025 Mission Foods Drag Racing Series schedule.\n\nThe event will continue to offer two rounds of pro qualifying on Friday, including a night session with fireworks, two final pro qualifying sessions on Saturday, and final eliminations on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWYTHE RACEWAY: Five-time series champion Chris Madden (Gray Court, S.C.) won Saturday\'s Schaeffer\'s Southern Nationals Super Late Model event.\n\nIt was the 29th career Southern Nationals victory for Madden, but first since 2020.\n\nDonald McIntosh (Dawsonville, Ga.) took second, with Benji Hicks (Mount Airy, N.C.), Dale McDowell (Chickamauga, Ga.) and Mike Benedum (Salem, W.Va.) rounding out the top five.

The Flames are hiring VCU\'s head coach Bradley LeCroy for the same position in Lynchburg, the university announced Monday night.\n\nLeCroy, a native of South Carolina and a four-year letterwinner at Clemson University from 1997 to 2000, comes to Liberty after a pair of seasons in Richmond that were capped off with a 2024 Atlantic 10 baseball tournament championship.\n\nIn a statement Monday night, Flames Director of Athletics Ian McCaw commented on LeCroy\'s "remarkable" turnaround at VCU and his two-decades worth of assistant coaching experience that made him worthy of the job.\n\n"Bradley is an outstanding baseball coach who thoroughly impressed us during the search process," McCaw said. "He is very relational, positive and embraces Liberty\'s Christian mission."\n\nLeCroy replaces outgoing head coach Scott Jackson, who resigned last week to accept a position on the coaching staff at North Carolina, where he previously served as an assistant from 2009 to 2016.\n\nIn those eight seasons, Jackson posted a 246-181 career record and became the first coach in program history to take the Flames to three regional appearances. But in the past two seasons, the Flames fell to sub-.500 records. They went 27-31 in 2023 and finished 24-34 in their debut season in Conference USA in 2024.\n\nLeCroy\'s rapid improvement at VCU, taking the team from 25-30 and a ninth-place finish in the Atlantic 10 in 2023 to a 38-23 record and NCAA Regional appearance in 2024, validated his reputation as a rising star in the college baseball community.\n\nHe was ranked as the No. 9 assistant coach in the nation by Baseball America prior to the 2013 season, and D1Baseball named him the No. 10 recruiter in the country before the 2017 campaign.\n\n"I want to thank Ian McCaw and [Senior Associate AD] Mickey Guridy for making this such a seamless process," Bradley said in the school\'s release. "While we will forever cherish our time at VCU, my family and I are looking forward to becoming a part of the Liberty family, and I am incredibly excited to be the next leader of the Liberty baseball program."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPrior to taking the VCU job in August 2022, the Clemson baseball alumnus (1997-2000) was an assistant coach at several programs, including Tennessee, Western Carolina and, most recently, Clemson.\n\nLeCroy has assistant coaching stints at his alma mater from 2003 to 2005 and 2011 to 2022.\n\nHe will now be tasked with keeping several Liberty baseball players who have entered the transfer portal this offseason -- including its offensive leader in 2024, Kane Kepley -- in the program.\n\nLeCroy\'s move will open up an immediate 30-day transfer portal window for any player with remaining eligibility from VCU. Jackson\'s move last week opened up a similar window for Liberty players.\n\nTwo Flames selected on Day Two of MLB Draft\n\nLiberty starter Cole Hertzler was the squad\'s No. 1 starter in 2024, and pitched to that title in his final start of the season against Sam Houston. The Pennsylvania native threw 120 pitches over 7 ⅔ innings of work, striking out five while allowing one run on four hits to put the Flames in the CUSA baseball tournament winners\' bracket on May 23.\n\nOn Monday, he was the first Liberty player off the board in the 2024 MLB Draft when the Houston Astros selected him with the No. 163 pick in the fifth round. One round later, the Texas Rangers selected Liberty pitcher Garrett Horn with the No. 195 overall pick.\n\nHertzler, a CUSA All-Conference second team selection this season, tossed 84 ⅓ innings for Liberty in 2024, striking out a team-high 94 batters while pitching to a 4.16 ERA. He went 6-6 and was also voted to the CUSA All-Tournament team after his stellar outing in the Flames\' opening game.\n\nHorn, a native of Kernersville, North Carolina, pitched just 20 innings for Liberty in 2024 before an arm injury. But in two seasons prior, he was one of the best arms in the Atlantic Sun.\n\nOver 137 ⅓ career innings, Horn posted a 3.28 ERA, going 13-7 in 36 appearances (26 starts). He fanned 196 batters to just 81 walks, and held opponents to a .203 batting average.\n\nDay Three of the 2024 MLB Draft begins at 2 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch\'s Zach Joachim contributed to this report.\n\nBryson Gordon, (434) 385-5529\n\nbgordon@newsadvance.com\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nBryson Gordon\n\nSports\n\nFollow Bryson Gordon\n\nClose Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nSave\n\nManage followed notifications\n\nClose Followed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature Log In\n\nDon\'t have an account?

Berikut tema dan link download logo resmi Hari Ulang Tahun (HUT) ke-79 Republik Indonesia (RI). Logo HUT Ke-79 RI bisa dimanfaatkan untuk membuat spanduk ataupun hiasan guna menyambut hari kemerdekaan.\n\nPemerintah resmi meluncurkan logo HUT Ke-79 RI. Tema yang diusung pada HUT Ke-79 RI adalah "Nusantara Baru, Indonesia Maju".\n\nBerikut ini makna dan link download logo resmi HUT Ke-79 RI. Link download logo resmi HUT ke-79 RI bisa digunakan untuk membuat kartu ucapan, spanduk, poster dll\n\nLink unduh logo HUT ke-79 RI\n\nLogo HUT ke-79 RI ini dapat di-download secara bebas dengan klik link ini, atau klik di bawah ini:\n\nLink download logo HUT ke-79 RI.\n\nDi link tersebut, terdapat pula buku Pedoman Identitas Visual HUT Ke-79 Kemerdekaan Republik Indonesia. Selain itu, juga terdapat template desain dan video motion penyambutan HUT ke-79 RI.\n\nDikutip dari Pedoman Identitas Visual HUT Ke-79 Kemerdekaan Republik Indonesia, logo HUT ke-79 RI dapat dimaknai melalui tujuh elemen di dalamnya, berikut penjelasannya:\n\nNegara kepulauan: Terdiri dari bagian-bagian yang terpisah yang merepresentasikan bentuk Indonesia sebagai negara kepulauan. Lambang negara: Ujung angka 7 menyerupai paruh Garuda, lambang negara yang berisi salah satu pilar kebangsaan yaitu Pancasila, serta melambangkan kekuatan negara. Pertumbuhan ekonomi: Angka 7 yang menyerupai panah ke kanan atas merupakan simbol harapan Indonesia untuk meningkatkan investasi dan ekspor untuk memenuhi misi indonesia dalam menggerakkan ekonomi. Keberlanjutan: Arah lengkungan dari segala arah yang saling terhubung satu sama lain, menyimbolkan prinsip pembangunan negara yang berkelanjutan. Ekonomi hijau: Bentuk dahan dan daun dari angka 9 merupakan prinsip pembangunan negara yang berlandaskan ekonomi hijau, bersinergi dengan alam, dan selalu memperhatikan akar budaya dan identitas. Persatuan dan harapan: Kaki angka 7 dan 9 terbuat dari bentuk yang sama, membentuk 2 tangan yang menyatu sebagai simbol persatuan masyarakat Indonesia walaupun memiliki pendapat yang berbeda-beda. Kesetaraan: Dua gelombang dengan arah yang sama di atas dan di bawah merepresentasikan tujuan Indonesia untuk desentralisasi dan memeratakan pembangunan demi mencapai kesetaraan.\n\nDesain terinsipirasi dari aliran sungai\n\nKepala Sekretariat Presiden (Kasetpres) selaku Ketua Pelaksana Peringatan HUT ke-79 Kemerdekaan RI, Heru Budi Hartono mengatakan bahwa desain grafis logonya terinspirasi dari aliran sungai yang menjadi sumber kehidupan. Umumnya, menurut dia, sungai memiliki cabang-cabang yang pada akhirnya akan mengarah pada satu muara yang sama.\n\n"Hal ini menyiratkan berbagai rumpun yang menyatukan kekuatan dan bergerak menuju Nusantara Baru Indonesia Maju," kata Budi, dilansir dari laman resmi Kemensetneg.\n\nElemen grafis pada logo HUT ke-79 RI tersebut juga menunjukkan koneksi dan dinamisme sesuai dengan aliran sungai. Bentuk keseluruhan dari logo ini meliuk-liuk dan panjang, menyerupai sungai terpanjang di Indonesia, yakni Sungai Kapuas di Kalimantan.\n\nItulah tema dan link download logo HUT ke-79 RI.

Using a reliable SEO tool is mandatory in 2024. This tool is characterized by affordable prices, powerful SEO features, and top-tier keyword research.\n\nMoreover, many people use it to track their website ranking and monitor the website\'s overall performance. SE Ranking is often overshadowed by superior options - Semrush is one of them. However, we discovered that this tool shouldn\'t be neglected.\n\nOur team has been using this software for well over a few years now. For this SE Ranking review for 2024, we tested it once again to bring you our "updated" thoughts on it and see how well it performs in all aspects, including SEO, content marketing, and many others.\n\nGetting Started With SE Ranking\n\nAt the start of our SE Ranking test, we\'ll discuss the start-up process, which is pretty simple. The service offers a few subscription plans that you can check using the button below. Select one, subscribe to it, and you\'re all set. SE Ranking greets you with its splendid interface.\n\nAs you can see, it looks gorgeous, and while it packs features, it\'s simpler than, let\'s say, Semrush. Some users complain about Semrush\'s slightly intimidating interface.\n\nVisit SE Ranking website\n\nNevertheless, SE Ranking lets you add the website to get the machine started. Click on "Add Website."\n\nDuring the setup process, you can also select the keywords to track and even your preferred search engine. In our SE Ranking review, we discovered it supports:\n\nAfter everything is set up, it\'ll take a while for the app to gather information. The more keywords you add, the more it\'ll take for everything to start. Regardless, that\'s a 5-minute process. SE Ranking displays everything clearly, which is a huge plus.\n\nThe menu on the left houses its features that we\'ll discuss in a minute in this SE Ranking test. The other portion of the screen is for graphs and other relevant information. Speaking of that, SE Ranking heavily relies on graphics instead of walls of raw text/data like Moz Pro.\n\nIt\'ll undoubtedly ensure your first impression is spot-on, dragging you down into its vortex and making every SEO analysis enjoyable.\n\nReview of SE Ranking Features\n\nBeing an all-around SEO tool, SE Ranking isn\'t shy when it comes to features. It offers some basic ones and some advanced tools you won\'t find in all of its competitors. After trying out and testing all of them, here\'s what we think about these features.\n\nCompetitive Research\n\nCompetitive Research is the first one you\'ll see. It\'s great for analyzing your competitors and seeing how they perform to improve your SEO accordingly. You can discover things like domain trust, page trust, organic traffic, the number of keywords, and so on.\n\nAnalyze your competitors with SE Ranking\n\nSE Ranking divulges even paid traffic and keywords along with total traffic cost. We like that it displays traffic distribution by country, which signals where the competitor you\'re analyzing is popular. Scrolling down a bit will show you graphs of the said parameters.\n\nYou\'ll see how the competitor\'s traffic, keywords, and other factors changed over the year or more. SE Ranking displays organic keywords and those that have improved, decreased, or are new or lost. Another feature we like is Intent - also found in Semrush.\n\nIt displays the intent behind the search for keywords. It can be informational, navigational, commercial, local, and transactional. SERP features can also be discovered, such as reviews, featured snippets, videos, site links, and many others.\n\nSE Ranking\'s paid traffic research is basic compared to Semrush. However, there\'s a Competitor Comparison where you can compare up to 2 websites to the analyzed domain. This is your Keyword Gap tool where you\'ll find out more about competitors\' keywords.\n\nCommon, missing, and unique keywords can be found promptly. From here, you can implement some of them and see if you can rank higher than your rivals.\n\nKeyword Research\n\nWhat about keyword research? Is SE Ranking efficient enough? The answer is a resounding YES.\n\nAfter providing the tool with the search term, you\'ll be greeted by an in-depth analysis of its difficulty, search volume, CPC, global volume, keyword ideas, intent, and so forth.\n\nSearch for new keywords with SE Ranking\n\nIts difficulty score is accurate enough and reflects the real-world situation. In some scenarios, it\'s too mild, so obviously "hard" keywords become a tad "easier" in SE Ranking\'s eyes. The tool will inform you if the keyword is "doable" and if not, you\'ll basic advice on how to rank for it.\n\nKeyword suggestions are handy as well. During our test of SE Ranking, we discovered a heap of them by visiting detailed keyword idea reports. You\'ll find similar and related phrases, as well as keyword-related questions. Each detailed report contains more information.\n\nThese include search volumes, trends, difficulty, and intent. Trends are especially valuable because they show you how popular the keyword was in the previous months. Organic results can also be found for the given keyword as they appear in Google SERPs.\n\nFinally, we\'ll briefly mention its Ads History. For every keyword you analyze, you\'ll find Ads History that displays popular ads for it. However, this feature isn\'t available in every plan, so if you\'re into PPC Advertising, you\'ll have to invest a bit more in SE Ranking.\n\nKeyword Manager\n\nAfter trying out the Keyword Manager, we found it\'s decent but not overly useful. It allows you to create bespoke keyword lists and manage them in multiple ways. Those lists can be exported to XLS or updated with new keywords.\n\nYou can add a list, name it, and then enter your keywords into them. Now, you can track each keyword and keep it under your watchful eye. Nothing too exciting, really.\n\nKeyword Grouper\n\nThe Keyword Grouper is slightly more interesting. It allows you to craft keyword clusters and group keywords based on their SERP similarity. Grouping accuracy is determined by you, from 1 to 9, and after entering the keywords, SE Ranking will promptly do the job.\n\nNow, the downside is that you\'ll pay $0.004 per query and if you\'re checking search volumes for each, that\'s an additional $0.005.\n\nIndex Status Checker\n\nThere\'s a nifty little feature called Index Status Checker that we tested in our SE Ranking analysis. It tells you if the page has been indexed by Google, Yahoo, or Bing. Again, it\'s paid additionally for some reason, so each check-up will cost $0.005.\n\nYou can do the same for free in Google Search Console, so what\'s the point? If you\'re looking to rank higher on Yahoo and Bing, however, this tool will be more valid.\n\nWebsite Audits\n\nSo let\'s discuss website audits in our in-depth review of SE Ranking. After trying out this function multiple times, we can only praise it.\n\nThe amount of data you get is unreal - from the health score to core web vitals, domain metrics, page indexation, page depth, and many others.\n\nWe appreciate that SE Ranking highlights the most pressing issues first. Clicking on them displays the problems in-depth and the tool offers solutions to fix them. Moreover, you\'ll get more information about your links - external and internal.\n\nYou\'ll see how many dofollow and nofollow links you have. Core web vitals can also be analyzed per device, so you can select from mobile or desktop options.\n\nAnother handy feature is the On-Page SEO Checker, which analyzes individual pages. We\'ve used this feature a lot in our SE Ranking test. It does a great job in this regard, pointing out the obvious qualities and flaws of each page. There\'s the Page Quality Score.\n\nYou\'ll see things like indexing, internal links, page experience, external links, SERP features, and others. On the right, SE Ranking displays SEO tasks to improve the page. This can be used to increase your Google ranking or drive more traffic.\n\nFor instance, we found that a few of our pages should be more unique. Some pages required minor fixes, such as adding the pages to the sitemap file or including keywords in the URL of the page. This stuff is easy to handle once you detect it.\n\nWe found Semrush\'s On-Page SEO Checker slightly better, however. It displays things like semantic ideas, content ideas, and top-10 benchmarking.\n\nStill, our experience with SE Ranking was positive and its On-Page SEO Checker was useful in many situations.\n\nSE Ranking Link Building (Backlink) Features\n\nRight off the bat, you\'ll notice SE Ranking\'s backlink analysis. Frankly, this isn\'t the best tool for link building compared to Semrush. For one, it doesn\'t have a link-building tool that lets you directly contact websites and request a backlink. Second, it\'s great only for analysis.\n\nAt least in this regard, the tool shines with a huge backlink database and plentiful information. Once you provide the link to the page, the interface will greet you with data like referring domains, backlinks, and anchor texts.\n\nWe love the toxic backlink analysis, which tells you more about your backlink profile. Toxic backlinks decrease your SEO and make ranking higher slower. SE Ranking also displays your non-toxic backlinks, highlighting what you did well.\n\nLike Semrush or Mangools LinkMiner, this tool displays new and lost backlinks. We like the top backlink anchors menu, highlighting the most prominent backlinks on your site. SE Ranking lets you analyze pages individually and examine their backlink profile.\n\nIn addition, we appreciate the ability to see the referring IP addresses of the backlinks. Finally, SE Ranking detects broken backlinks efficiently. This is another crucial factor that must be eliminated if you want to maximize your SEO scores.\n\nBacklink Gap Analyzer\n\nOur experience with SE Ranking led us to its Backlink Gap Analyzer which worked well for the most part. You can add up to 5 competitors and run the analysis to see which domains link to your competitors but not to your website.\n\nThis function is overly simple and doesn\'t contain much information. Yes, you\'ll find all the referring domains and backlinks, which is handy. But Semrush is much better, offering the option to see weak, strong, shared, and unique backlinks.\n\nIt also lets you access its link-building tool directly from here, as you can send the displayed prospects to it. As said, SE Ranking will "inadvertently" improve your backlink profile but not directly like Semrush, which is the #1 SEO tool in this case.\n\nSE Ranking has two excellent content management tools we tested. These tools are paramount for improving your content, ensuring better keyword optimization, and providing better readability to increase dwell time.\n\nContent Editor\n\nSE Ranking\'s Content Editor is the tool we liked a lot in our review. It lets you write articles directly or copy them to the empty page and let the tool analyze them. We love the fact that it\'s a full-fledged writing tool where you can format the article the way you want.\n\nMoreover, the right-hand side is handy for getting more info about the text. Under "Improvements", you\'ll see the content score based on factors like text length, headings, and used terms (keywords). SE Ranking will list the keywords you need to use too.\n\nThe main keyword is displayed first and the software advises using it in the first 100 words, for example. In the Quality tab, you\'ll find metrics like your grammar, stop words, and punctuation. The readability score is also here, indicating how accessible your article is.\n\nOf course, SE Ranking lets you check for plagiarism, alas, only in more expensive plans. We\'ll address that later in our SE Ranking test. The Outline tab is also handy. It analyzes content structure, competitors, links, and keywords for a better overview of the article.\n\nPerhaps the most useful tool is the AI Writer, similar to the one found in Semrush. It lets you generate content based on your needs. For instance, we like its FAQ Section option. We used it to fill our guides with answers to frequently asked questions.\n\nIn addition, AI Writer supports a few tones of voice, such as conversational, authoritative, informational, and a few others. Its AI Writer goes a long way in creating bespoke content without hassle, which can be helpful for faster, yet more efficient content creation.\n\nContent Idea Finder\n\nThis feature is exactly what it sounds like. We discovered its usefulness when brainstorming content ideas for our few websites. To use it, you need to enter the seed keyword and select the country you\'re aiming for. SE Ranking will then create so-called clusters.\n\nThese clusters contain keywords based on the seed keyword you provided. For the "SEO Software" seed keyword, there\'s an "SEO Engine Optimization" cluster. When we click on it, we get numerous cluster ideas with their CPC, difficulty, volume, and competition.\n\nClicking on Titles gives you ideas you can use to title your article - as you can see below, they\'re pretty sensical and good-looking. For a more graphical explanation, SE Ranking includes the Mind Map of clusters you generate.\n\nIn the middle is your seed keyword, while the lines originating from the center are clusters. Clicking on one displays cluster keywords on the right and lets you explore the possible titles. In terms of content management, SE Ranking did a splendid job in our analysis.\n\nHowever, it\'s still a tad underwhelming compared to Semrush. Semrush includes the SEO Content Template, which comes with data like semantically related words, advised backlinks, the readability score you should aim for, and the needed word count for the given term.\n\nLocal Marketing\n\nSE Ranking offers excellent Local Marketing that aids the improvement of local SEO. It\'s a great Ahrefs alternative in this regard, based on our experience with both. We found it pretty simple to use. You can target multiple locations, again, depending on your subscription.\n\nYou can choose from 1 to 50 locations from $7 to $181 a month respectively. Local Marketing is an optional add-on, so if you don\'t need it, you don\'t have to pay for it. If you do, you can add a location and track your ranking in it.\n\nFurthermore, we like the Local Marketing Audit tool. It gives you a score and displays possible issues that harm your local SEO. SE Ranking can also track your Google Business Profile and display views, searches by keywords, and total searches.\n\nWe love that you can see Search and Google Maps views from desktop and mobile platforms separately. If you have a phone line, you can even examine the number of phone calls and messages over a specific period. Reviews can also be tracked.\n\nYou\'ll see the reviews from Google, Facebook, and other websites. SE Ranking shows all of them, with the rating date, and the review content. It\'ll display if you\'ve answered the review as well, ensuring you\'re always in touch with your customers, which adds to your local SEO.\n\nSE Ranking Pricing: How Much Does It Cost?\n\nUnlike Semrush and Mangools, SE Ranking doesn\'t have a free plan - quite a shame. Perhaps, you could read our free SEO tools guide if you have no money to pay.\n\nDiscover SE Ranking\'s offers\n\nHowever, SE Ranking is very affordable, and in this review, we\'ll see it costs way less than its many rivals.\n\nThe Essential plan starts at $44/mo for the annual plan, so it\'s super affordable. To remind you - Semrush starts at over $100/mo! The Essential plan buys you 1 user seat and up to 5 projects. It includes almost all tools from this review of SE Ranking.\n\nHowever, it lacks API access and historical data on domains and keywords. Its Agency Pack, which includes white label reporting and lead generator, can\'t be purchased. The best-value plan is in the middle. It\'s a Pro plan at $87.2/mo for the annual deal.\n\nIt excludes API access but includes everything else. Local Marketing can be bought and so can the Agency Pack, which can only be paid manually a whopping $600! The Pro plan analyzes 2,000 to 3,500 keywords daily compared to the Essential plan with 750 keywords.\n\nFinally, there\'s the Business plan at $191.2/mo. Instead of 3 user seats in the Pro plan, it allows for 5 seats and unlimited projects. It can also track from 5,000 to 15,000 keywords daily, in which case, the price increases to $456/mo.\n\nPrice Review of Other Features\n\nSE Ranking\'s monthly plans are there if you don\'t want to commit for a year. However, they\'re 20% more expensive per month, so they\'re likely not an option. As said in this SE Ranking review, the service includes a few optional extras.\n\nFor instance, its Content Editor is always paid extra and costs from $29/mo to $99/mo, while the Content Idea Finder is a standard feature. The price of the Content Editor depends on several factors displayed below.\n\nThe Agency Pack, as said, costs $600 annually and it\'s the only way of paying for it. An upfront payment of $600 is significant and we dislike the lack of monthly payments for it. If you need to work on your local SEO, here are the packages:\n\nWe also mentioned in this in-depth review that the service charges you extra for some features. These include Keyword Grouper, Parameter Checker, Index Status Checker, Search Engine Autocomplete, and Search Volume Checker.\n\nThese features cost from $0.001 to $0.005 per query/request/keyword/URL. SE Ranking has a 14-day free trial without a credit card. However, the service is non-refundable, which isn\'t a deal breaker considering a generous free trial for testing purposes.\n\nSE Ranking Pros\n\nSE Ranking Cons\n\nVerdict\n\nAfter testing SE Ranking extensively for years, we can conclude it\'s one of the best SEO tools to try out. It has plenty of things going for it and is more adorable than many of its rivals. SE Ranking is cheaper than Semrush but not better. It is, however, a close second, which is great.\n\nThis tool works well for many purposes. Competitive research, keyword analysis, content marketing, and local SEO - all of these will be covered by this tool. With an easy-to-use interface and flexible pricing, we think you\'ll end up more satisfied than you expect.\n\nIts downsides are minor, especially at this price point. If you want more advanced features and SEO-related data, consider using our Semrush coupon. If you\'re an average or even slightly above average user, we\'re confident that SE Ranking will be sufficient.', 'source': {'uri': 'gizmodo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Gizmodo'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/06/SE-Ranking-review.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 458782142, 'relevance': 105}

Simone Biles, renowned for her extraordinary gymnastics achievements, including numerous Olympic and World Championship titles, joined ...\n\nSimone Biles has spent the last three years moving past the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe gymnastics superstar understands not everyone has.\n\nNo matter how many national titles she wins or how times she stands atop the podium at the world championships, Biles knows she remains frozen in time to critics unwilling or unable to forgive her for pulling out of multiple finals at the 2020 Games to protect herself.\n\nThe proof is in her mentions, the ones she says she tries to ignore but still stumbles across anyway.\n\nThe 27-year-old wants to make something clear as she prepares for a third trip to the Olympics: the redemption she is seeking later this month has nothing to do with silencing those who will tune in just to see if "the twisties" resurface. Mostly because she knows there\'s no use.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNEW DETAILS: John Deere announces another 345 layoffs at Waterloo facilities Colleagues remember Waverly-Shell Rock principal Suz SmolikHagen One dead in early morning shooting in Hudson UPDATE WITH NAME: One dead in tanker crash south of Hudson Four injured in wrong-way crash Student sentenced to probation in University of Northern Iowa Dance Marathon theft Walnut Ridge Church to move to Tower Park Drive, future uncertain for private school space Waterloo man arrested after alleged assault at Sunnyside County Club Iowa restaurant inspection update: Grimy blenders, mouse droppings and bad sushi Pet friendly restaurants, bars, coffee shops with patio guidelines Waterloo day care operator charged with three counts of child endangerment Former Juvenile Court Services employee indicted for fraud in cedit card case John Eveland: Waterloo businessman makes lasting impact in Cedar Valley community Man arrested in 2017 up-skirt photo investigation Trump injured but \'fine\' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead\n\n"They\'ll still say like, \'Oh my gosh, you\'re going to quit again? Or are you going to quit again?\' And like, and \'If I did, what are you going to do about it? Tweet me some more?\'" Biles said after winning the Olympic trials last month. "Like I\'ve already dealt with it for three years. But yeah, they want to see us fail."\n\nLife happens\n\nThe woman who will step onto the floor with the rest of the U.S. team during qualifying on July 28 is not the one who left Japan at the center of the sometimes uncomfortable conversation about mental health.\n\nShe has evolved, both personally and professionally, committing herself to therapy -- even during meets -- and making sure her sport no longer defines her, all the while looking perhaps as good as ever more than a decade removed from the first of her record six world all-around titles.\n\nBiles married current Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens in the spring of 2023 and her busy personal calendar is dotted with the mileposts of a normal 20-something: from baby showers to weddings to overseeing the details of the house she and her husband are building in the Houston suburbs.\n\nWhen one of her former Olympic teammates welcomed her first child late last year, Biles admitted she felt a pang of "that\'s what I should be doing."\n\nOnly she\'s not. Not yet anyway. Two decades after she took up the sport, Biles still finds herself inside World Champions Centre -- the gym the Biles family owns in Spring, Texas -- countless hours a week. Still flipping. Still twisting. Still "testing my life every day" while dispelling the myth that elite gymnasts peak in their late teens.\n\nWhy?\n\n"I think with everything I\'ve been through, I want to push the limits, I want to see how far I can go," she said. "I want to see what I\'m still capable of so once I step away from this sport, I can truly be happy with my career and say I gave it my all."\n\nMentor and friend\n\nEven as her definition of "all" is changing. The teenage prodigy has become an elder stateswoman who has grown comfortable leading from the front.\n\nWhen good friend and 2020 Olympic champion Sunisa Lee tripped and fell on vault at the U.S. Championships in June -- a scene eerily similar to the sequence that led Biles to remove herself from the team final in Tokyo -- Biles ran over to offer support.\n\nAt the 2023 world championships, Joscelyn Roberson suffered an ankle injury that forced her to miss the vault finals. Biles did her best to lighten the mood by cracking jokes. And when Roberson found herself struggling during a sometimes grueling rehab, Biles left a note of encouragement in Roberson\'s locker that urged her to keep trying.\n\nWhen Jade Carey had problems with her Amanar vault at the Olympic trials, Biles reminded the reigning floor exercise gold medalist to take a step forward on her dismount, something Carey laughingly noted she didn\'t actually do.\n\n"It\'s just really great to have someone like her supporting all of us and helping us get through it," Carey said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA singular talent\n\nIt wasn\'t always that way. There has always been an unspoken otherness around Biles. Part of the team -- the center of it most times -- to be sure, but also a one-of-one.\n\n"I\'m like, \'Can you stop being so good and fall every now and then?\'" said Alicia Sacramone Quinn, the co-lead of the U.S. senior women\'s program. "Her talent and her just level of difficulty and her general ability as an athlete, it is mindblowing."\n\nWhen people in Quinn\'s personal life ask her about Biles, Quinn -- whose resume includes 11 medals between the world championships and Olympics -- just shakes her head.\n\n"What you see on TV doesn\'t even do it justice," Quinn said. "Her gymnastics has brought such a larger pool of an audience because people want to see what she can do."\n\nOr, in the case of some, what she can\'t.\n\nCall it the byproduct of making things impossibly hard look impossibly easy so often it sets a standard that no one else -- Biles herself sometimes included -- can match.\n\nDouble-edged sword\n\nThat is the beauty and also the weight of the Olympics, a lesson Biles learned after Tokyo, when all of the glory and gold she brought to the U.S. program through the years suddenly didn\'t matter to a group bent for some reason on taking her down.\n\n"I do think there\'s an unfairness to it because you only watched it once and then if they fall it\'s, \'Oh she sucks\' and it\'s like, \'No, you\'re still sitting on the couch and they\'re still at the Olympics what are you talking about they sucked? They\'re the best in their country,\'" Biles said. "So it\'s hard."\n\nBiles is willingly putting herself under the white-hot microscope the Games provide for a third time, obligated not by ego or fame or money but respect for her own talent.\n\n"Knowing Simone and just the fighter that she is, she will definitely want to leave on what she considers on top," her mother Nellie said. "That I think is what Simone wants for Simone."\n\nAnd what Biles wants more than anything else at this point in her life, is peace. There\'s a very real chance this could be it for an athlete who jokes "I\'m ancient now. Forget grandma, I\'m past that."\n\nShe\'s past a lot of things. Maybe Tokyo most of all.\n\nA final bow?\n\nShe has taken very methodical steps to protect herself in the run-up to Paris. Her therapist remains on call. Her family -- Jonathan included -- will be in the stands. She will be surrounded by friends on the competition floor who know perhaps better than anyone the pressure Biles faces.\n\nAnd then Biles will salute the judges -- the ones who do the scoring and in some ways, the ones sitting at home too -- and throw herself into the breach once more, perhaps for the last time.\n\nMaybe Paris ends with her hand over her heart as "The Star-Bangled Banner" plays as it has so many times before. Maybe it ends like Tokyo. While she\'s taken steps to make sure that doesn\'t happen, she won\'t really know until she does it.\n\nEither way it goes, Biles plans on walking away on her terms. The woman who has redefined gymnastics is no longer letting her gymnastics or the once-every-four-year experts define her.\n\nShe has been quiet about what comes next. She will headline a post-Olympic tour, just as she did three years ago. After that, who knows?\n\nThe greatest gymnast of all time may have offered a hint at the end of Olympic trials. Biles was talking about the nature of being a high-profile athlete and the inevitable pushback that comes with it. She was speaking in generalities while leaving plenty of space to read between the lines.\n\n"They want to see the downfall, which is really unfortunate because sports hasn\'t seen athletes like we\'ve seen before," she said. "So you really have to give them their flowers in the sport because once they\'re gone, you\'re going to miss them."\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'wcfcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'charlie_riedel@wcfcourier.com', 'name': 'Charlie Riedel', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'rebecca_blackwell@wcfcourier.com', 'name': 'Rebecca Blackwell', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wcfcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/2e/22ef8a2d-4ce3-5ef0-bf34-765ec8c1bf04/66958d07be546.preview.jpg?crop=1747%2C917%2C5%2C103&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9734092', 'sentiment': 0.1372549019607843, 'wgt': 458780265, 'relevance': 6}

These facilities require millions of gallons of water annually. For instance, Microsoft estimates that its Goodyear, Arizona, data center will consume around 56 million gallons of drinking water each year, a notable figure for an area already facing water scarcity, Wired reports.\n\nThe website highlights the inefficiency of data centers compared to household water use. "The water that is available for people to use is very limited," an AI researcher at UC Riverside, Shaolei Ren, told the magazine. "It\'s just the fresh surface water and groundwater. Those data centers, they\'re just evaporating water into the air."\n\n"When we get the water from the utility, and then we discharge the water back to the sewage immediately, we are just withdrawing water -- we\'re not consuming water. A data center takes the water from this utility, and they evaporate the water into the sky, into the atmosphere."\n\nDespite these considerable resources, the everyday benefits of AI, such as chatbots and image generators, are often debated. Google\'s AI search summaries, for example, have been criticized for lacking accuracy while using significantly more energy than traditional search methods.\n\n"In the back end, these algorithms that need to be running for any generative AI model are fundamentally very, very different from the traditional kind of Google Search or email," said an AI researcher at the University of Washington, Sajjad Moazeni.\n\n"For basic services, those were very light in terms of the amount of data that needed to go back and forth between the processors," he said.', 'source': {'uri': 'nysun.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Sun'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'joseph_curl@nysun.com', 'name': 'Joseph Curl', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/openAI.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1137254901960785, 'wgt': 458776217, 'relevance': 8}

Harman was in the back seat of an SUV. The destination was not much longer than the 40-foot birdie putt he made last year on the 14th hole on his way to winning the Open. But he had to wait for the film crew to be set, for the traffic on the road to clear.\n\n"It\'s all yours," Harman told Martin Slumbers, the R&A CEO who took back golf\'s oldest trophy that apparently has seen its share of the finest wine and bourbon in the year since Harman won at Royal Liverpool.\n\nHarman is a straight shooter -- with a rifle, with his mouth and last year with his putter -- but a staged moment as this didn\'t bother him.\n\n"In my opinion, it\'s the coolest trophy in all of sports," Harman said. "So I think it\'s deserving of all of the pageantry that\'s involved with it."\n\nGetting it back by the end of the week is the real challenge.\n\nThe homecoming of the claret jug was an unofficial way to launch the start of the final men\'s major of the year. The 152nd Open Championship begins Thursday on the Scottish links along the Firth of Clyde on the Irish Sea.\n\nRoyal Troon is renowned for its pot bunkers that are so deep they effectively serve as a one-shot penalty when tee shots find them on the longer holes. The outward holes are shorter with the prevailing wind, the inward holes are longer and into the wind.\n\n"You have to take them on," Scottie Scheffler said.\n\nHarman had gone six years without a win until putting together a masterpiece last year to lead over the final 51 holes and win by six. He hasn\'t won since then, a matter of getting his putter to cooperate. He hopes that\'s the case this week.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"You can work and work and work. You just never know when that work is going to pay off," Harman said. "You never know when the peak is coming. You never know when you\'re going to catch a little bit of momentum. So you just have to hope it\'s a big week."\n\nNo one has won back to back in the British Open since Padraig Harrington in 2007 (Carnoustie) and 2008 (Royal Birkdale). Go back to 1960 and the list of repeat winners includes only Tiger Woods, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino and Arnold Palmer.\n\n"A little sad to give it back, but I\'ll remember everywhere it\'s been forever," Harman said. "I\'m happy to give it back, happy to be here. Ready to get going."\n\nRoyal Troon is green and lush, and the rough is particularly thick at the base of turf. This isn\'t likely to be a bright and sunny week along the Ayrshire coast, and the links have been busy.\n\nWoods arrived Sunday and went 18 holes, spending much of his time chipping and putting. His son Charlie is not with him, instead at home preparing for the U.S. Junior Amateur next week outside Detroit.\n\nScheffler got into the competitive spirit, playing alongside Sam Burns as they took some cash from PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay.\n\nAfter handing off the jug, Harman headed out to see Royal Troon for the first time. Monday was largely a day of reflection and he was eager to move forward.\n\nBut it was a good year, even without another win. He took the jug to Georgia Bulldogs football and Atlanta Braves baseball games. He took it everywhere he could, a reminder of reaching the pinnacle of his sport.\n\n"You never know how it\'s going to go, but just the reception from everyone back home was overwhelming, just how excited everyone was," he said. "I was obviously very excited, but to be able to share that excitement with people that I care about was probably the best."\n\nHarman was among several players who came across the coast from the Scottish Open last week, a list that included Robert MacIntyre, though his immediately whereabouts could not be confirmed. MacIntyre won the Scottish with an eagle-par-birdie finish and promised he would "celebrate hard" as the first Scot to win his national open in 25 years.\n\nHe was scheduled for a press conference Monday afternoon. It was rescheduled for Wednesday afternoon. That was a big win for him. Next up is one even bigger.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf', 'source': {'uri': 'omaha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Omaha.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'doug_ferguson@omaha.com', 'name': 'Doug Ferguson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/d5/bd5621d6-cc3e-5f59-ab58-a486844b83bd/669593be3c877.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1843137254901961, 'wgt': 458775577, 'relevance': 30}

VCU Athletics declined to comment as of Monday afternoon.\n\nBeset by injuries, transfers and inconsistency on the mound, LeCroy\'s first Rams team in 2023 finished 25-30 and missed out on the Atlantic 10 tournament it hosted at The Diamond.\n\nBut the former Clemson assistant turned things around in his second year.\n\nLed by conference player of the year Brandon Eike (Powhatan High), VCU went 38-23, won an A-10 tournament title and earned a marquee, 1-0 win over No. 22 Wake Forest in the opening round of the Greenville Regional.\n\nLeCroy, a Clemson baseball alumnus (1997-2000) and former assistant at Tennessee, Western Carolina and Division II Anderson University (S.C.), was hired as the seventh coach in VCU baseball history on Aug. 2, 2022, replacing Shawn Stiffler (Notre Dame).\n\nLeCroy is viewed as somewhat of a rising star in the college baseball coaching community.\n\nHe was ranked as the No. 9 assistant coach in the nation by Baseball America prior to the 2013 season, and D1Baseball named him the No. 10 recruiter in the country before the 2017 campaign.\n\nLeCroy will replace former Flames coach Scott Jackson, who resigned last week "to pursue other opportunities in college baseball," according to a July 11 release from the school.\n\nOver eight seasons, Jackson posted a career record of 246-181. His 246 career wins and .576 winning percentage rank third in program history among Liberty\'s seven head coaches.\n\n"I deeply appreciate Coach Jackson\'s many contributions to Liberty baseball over the past eight seasons," said Flames vice president and director of athletics Ian McCaw in the school\'s release.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"His efforts led the program to great success on the field while providing an exceptional, Christ-centered experience for our student-athletes.\n\n"We are excited to build on the strong foundation in place including outstanding facilities, resources and support."\n\nIt could be debated what sort of move the shift from VCU to Liberty symbolizes for LeCroy. The Rams finished last season No. 73 nationally in RPI. Liberty went 24-34 overall, 11-13 in Conference USA.\n\nThe Flames, in a down year by their standards, finished 122nd nationally in RPI. It was the program\'s second consecutive losing season.\n\nBut as recently as 2022, Liberty went 37-23 and earned a spot in the Gainesville Regional, where it fell to Oklahoma and Central Michigan.\n\nIn 2021, Liberty posted a 41-16 mark and made it to the final of the Knoxville Regional, its second regional final in program history.\n\nSo it appears that Flames athletics administration tabbed LeCroy as the man to turn fortunes around for a program that has experienced success in recent years, but floundered in the last couple seasons under Jackson.\n\nThe path forward for VCU baseball is unclear. Faced with their second coaching change in quick succession, the Rams are likely to encounter ample roster turnover this offseason.\n\nAny VCU player with remaining undergraduate eligibility that is not already in the transfer portal has until August 14 to enter their name.\n\nAfter VCU\'s season ended in the Greenville Regional, LeCroy was bullish on the future of his program.\n\n"I told the guys who are returning, \'This isn\'t the end,\'" LeCroy said in early June.\n\n"Our goal is to get into a regional, win it, get into a super regional, win it, and knock the door down to get to Omaha. If you don\'t talk about, if you don\'t believe it, you can\'t achieve it."\n\nIt will be of particular interest to see how LeCroy\'s departure affects VCU\'s incoming recruiting class, a group that includes local standouts such as Mills Godwin P/OF Hank Piersol, Douglas Freeman P Cayman Goode, Matoaca C Jacob Lee, and Benedictine P/OF Elijah Coston and P Riley Roarty.\n\n"It\'s huge to keep those guys in the city," LeCroy said of that group.\n\n"VCU\'s got a really strong brand, especially in baseball. Those guys that have the ties to the community and ties to VCU, there\'s no doubt in my mind that they take more pride in what they\'re doing and want to do great things for their own school in their own city."\n\nZach Joachim (804) 649-6555\n\nzjoachim@timesdispatch.com\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'newsadvance.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NewsAdvance.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newsadvance.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/81/181f6fd7-41a1-5018-ae74-6ee30e6a237d/66958c28a9d0f.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 458773444, 'relevance': 51}

Golfers Xander Schauffele and Nelly Korda, along with surfer Carissa Moore, are among the numerous Olympians set to defend their titles in France.\n\nIt\'s a loaded U.S. roster where the women outnumber the men 314 to 278, and ages range from 16 to 59. The most decorated member of Team USA in Paris will be Ledecky, who\'s trying to add to her collection of 10 medals (seven golds).\n\nComebacks and redemption\n\nBiles is back in action after pulling out of multiple gymnastics finals in Tokyo to protect her mental health and safety. There\'s Richardson making her Olympic debut after a much-debated absence three years ago because of a positive marijuana test.\n\nBiles leads a U.S. women\'s gymnastics team filled with familiar faces and looking for redemption in Paris. The team settled for silver three years ago behind the Russian athletes competing as the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nRichardson has become a media sensation for her speed, charisma and perseverance. The 100-meter world champion earned a spot for Tokyo in 2021 but was banned following her positive test for marijuana. It sparked an intense debate about whether she was being unfairly singled out for taking a substance that doesn\'t improve performance.\n\nThe 24-year-old Richardson, who graces the cover of Vogue magazine, said she was "overwhelmed with the emotions of just joy" after making the team.\n\nStar power on the court\n\nOn the court, hoops royalty LeBron James and Diana Taurasi lead their teams. And it\'s no surprise that the men\'s and women\'s basketball squads brimming with talent are heavy favorites to bring home the gold.\n\nJames, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry join forces to lead a U.S. contingent going for a fifth straight Olympic title. A\'ja Wilson, Brittney Griner and Taurasi headline a women\'s squad that has won seven consecutive Olympic gold medals. Taurasi has been apart of five of them.\n\nWho else is on the Team USA roster?\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDecorated swimmers Ledecky and Caeleb Dressel are on deck to shine again in the pool, and majors winners and world No. 1 golfers Scottie Scheffler and Korda take to the links.\n\n"We\'re telling these stories -- we\'re laughing, we\'re crying, we\'re cheering them on," said Lyndsay Signor, senior vice president of consumer engagement at NBC Sports. "So that really warrants both the combination of the athletes themselves and the celebrities we\'ve partnered with."\n\nNBC has been airing promotional Olympic material around the clock. There\'s Biles being interviewed by singer SZA. Other athletes featured in spots include Richardson, sprinter Noah Lyles, 400-meter hurdles world-record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Ledecky and reigning Olympic all-around gymnastics winner Suni Lee.\n\nThe U.S. women\'s soccer team, led by new coach Emma Hayes, chases after its first Olympic gold since 2012 and Victor Montalvo -- "B-Boy Victor" -- will be a contender when breaking makes its Olympic debut in Paris. Coco Gauff is among the favorites to bring home a medal on the clay courts at Roland Garros, the site of the French Open.\n\nMedal forecast\n\nThat abundance of star power is why Nielsen\'s Gracenote forecasts the U.S. hauling in 123 medals. That\'s ahead of China (87), Britain (62) and France (56). This could be the eighth straight Summer Games where the Americans have topped the medal table.\n\n"If American athletes win, that drives ratings and endorsements, and makes it attractive for American corporations to invest in the Olympic movement," said Dr. Yoav Dubinsky, an instructor of sports business from the Lundquist College of Business at the University of Oregon. "All part of the story of American lifestyle. Their successes, and at times failures or adversities, contribute to Brand America."\n\nOlympic entertainers\n\nNBC brought in Academy Award-winning director Steven Spielberg to narrate a short film titled, "Land of Stories," where the Olympics set a scene to tell tales.\n\nEven more stars will participate in the network\'s coverage as celebrities Snoop Dogg, Kelly Clarkson, Peyton Manning, Colin Jost, Leslie Jones and Jimmy Fallon make appearances.\n\nSnoop already is trotting out his tracksuits to get in some work. The 52-year-old hip-hop star ran a 200-meter race against Ato Boldon and Wallace Spearmon at the Olympic track trials in Eugene, Oregon, last month.\n\nHis time was 34.44 seconds. Usain Bolt\'s world record of 19.19 remains safe.\n\n"(Snoop) has really brought a perspective that\'s not only fun and interesting," Signor said, "it\'s lovable as well."\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games', 'source': {'uri': 'omaha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Omaha.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/07/907537bf-f790-5414-ac87-e34375cf48bd/669585626659f.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1843137254901961, 'wgt': 458772741, 'relevance': 51}

The event, held at Encore Las Vegas, brought together NBA players and gaming enthusiasts in a unique fusion of sports and esports.\n\nBronny James clinched the title by triumphing over Williams in a special Modern Warfare III map, showcasing his gaming prowess. This win marks a significant achievement for James, as he joins the ranks of competitive gaming champions. Last year\'s tournament saw Jaylin Williams of the Oklahoma City Thunder take home the prize, but this year belonged to Bronny.\n\nIn the final moments of the tournament, Bronny showcased his skills in a two-minute drill contest, where he outscored Williams and Detroit Pistons\' Bobi Klintman. With an impressive 84 points, James obliterated the 59 points that secured last year\'s title for Jaylin Williams.\n\nThis performance earned him a custom-made Call of Duty championship belt and a $10,000 prize, solidifying his status as a formidable gamer, one of the best in the league.\n\nThe players also got an exclusive preview of the recently announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, adding to the excitement of the event. Bronny James\' victory in the tournament highlights his versatility and competitive spirit, extending beyond the basketball court.\n\nDespite facing challenges in the NBA Summer League, where he has struggled with shooting, Bronny\'s success in the Call of Duty tournament is a testament to his determination and skill. His performance in the tournament has earned him respect and recognition, proving that he is capable of excelling in multiple arenas.\n\nBronny\'s victory also holds symbolic significance as he continues to carve his own path, independent of his father\'s legendary career. While LeBron James prepares for the upcoming Olympics with Team USA, Bronny is making headlines with his accomplishments in esports.\n\nThe Call of Duty tournament win is a highlight of Bronny\'s summer, demonstrating his ability to compete at a high level both on and off the court. As he continues to develop his skills in the NBA, fans can look forward to seeing more from this talented young athlete, whether in basketball or gaming.\n\nBronny James Doesn\'t Have Michael Jordan In 5 Most Favorite Players Of All-Time\n\nBronny James, the son of NBA superstar LeBron James, recently made headlines with his surprising list of top five favorite NBA players of all time. In a recent interview with ESPN, Bronny revealed his selections, and the list notably excluded Michael Jordan, widely considered one of the greatest basketball players in history.\n\n"LeBron - one, Steph - two, Kyrie - three, KD - four, and Ant and Shai tied for the five."\n\nBronny\'s favorite players are all current stars, with his father, LeBron James, unsurprisingly at the top. Following LeBron, Bronny chose Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and a tie between Anthony Edwards and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. This list reflects Bronny\'s admiration for players he has grown up watching and, in some cases, personally interacting with.\n\nThe omission of Michael Jordan, a six-time NBA champion and five-time MVP, is particularly surprising given Jordan\'s legendary status in the sport. Additionally, the exclusion of Kobe Bryant, another all-time great and a Lakers icon, raised eyebrows among fans.\n\nBronny\'s choices highlight the generational shift in basketball fandom, as younger players like him tend to idolize contemporary stars they can see and interact with.\n\nBronny\'s selections sparked a lively debate on social media, with many fans and analysts weighing in on his unconventional picks. While some understand his preference for current players he grew up watching, others believe that legends like Jordan and Bryant deserve a place on any all-time list.\n\nThe scrutiny on Bronny has been intense, especially as he navigates his rookie year with the Los Angeles Lakers after being selected 55th overall in the 2024 NBA Draft. Despite his challenges in the NBA Summer League, where he has struggled to find his rhythm, Bronny remains a focal point of attention due to his lineage and potential.\n\nAs Bronny continues to develop his game, he will undoubtedly face comparisons to the all-time greats, including those he chose to leave off his list. His journey in the NBA is just beginning, and he will have ample opportunity to carve out his own legacy while paying homage to the players who inspire him.\n\nRelated: Gilbert Arenas On Expectations From Bronny James: Stands Up And Claps - \'Go Daddy Go\'\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

The sites had closed when the water gage at Waterloo reads at a stage height of 5-feet or greater. The access sites will now close when the water gage reads a stage height of 4-feet or greater.\n\n"The Elkhorn River has degraded at least two feet over the past five years, likely due to the large flood events that have occurred," said John Winkler, the NRD general manager. "This has resulted in higher water levels, increased water flows and no visible sandbars. This makes recreation more dangerous."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWinkler says recreation is more conducive at the new stage height as sandbars are either visible or just below the surface. As is always the case, Winkler says before sites can reopen, river access ramps may need to be cleaned of silt, debris and safety inspected.\n\nThe Elkhorn River access sites: Elkhorn Crossing at the intersection of 252nd & Bennington Road; West Maple Road at West Maple Road northeast of Waterloo; and Graske Crossing at southeast corner of West Dodge Road and west of 204th Street.\n\nThe access sites are open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. through Nov. 1. River-goers can find out whether the access sites are open or closed by going to the Papio-Missouri NRD website.\n\nPhotos: The Missouri River floods in Omaha', 'source': {'uri': 'omaha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Omaha.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'kevin_cole@omaha.com', 'name': 'Kevin Cole', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/15/f15f643a-42c8-11ef-a5ce-735d5bae1752/6695564c21608.preview.jpg?crop=1838%2C965%2C153%2C0&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1137254901960785, 'wgt': 458761341, 'relevance': 51}

"What do you do in case of a fire emergency?" He normally asks the crowd of children. "Stop, drop and roll," they say.\n\n"What do you do if you\'re drowning?" More often than not, the kids stay silent.\n\n"Now, how often do you play in fire?" He asks. Heads shake. "And how often do you play in water?" For many children and teens, the answer to this last question is: Every. Single. Summer.\n\nDrowning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is responsible for more deaths among children age 1 to 4 than all other causes except birth defects. For children age 1 to 14, drowning remains the second-leading cause of unintentional injury-related deaths, just behind motor vehicle crashes. Water safety, Benjamin (pictured speaking) said, "is not common sense." Even the most advanced swimmers could be at risk.\n\nA precautionary tale\n\nOn July 27, 2013, 15-year-old Matthew Kocher was away from home on a camp trip to New Buffalo City Beach in New Buffalo, Michigan, earning community service hours for school. While standing in the shallow Lake Michigan waters, Kocher got caught in a rip current.\n\n"We were basically pool people, like most people," John Kocher (pictured in orange), Matthew\'s father, said.\n\nMatthew had little experience in open water. Kocher suspects his son and several other people in his camp group, were unaware that the waving red flags on the beach signaled hazardous water condition\n\nThe Matthew Kocher Foundation\n\nAfter Matthew\'s funeral, John and his wife, Kathy, set up a foundation in their son\'s name. They have since partnered with Benjamin and the GLSRP to sponsor more than 300 water safety talks in Illinois.\n\nThe following are the water safety tips they hope will save a life.\n\n"We would have told Matt about this. Matt would have listened," John said. "He was that kind of kid."\n\n1. Know before you go\n\n"Check the weather reports, check the wave reports and check for a rip-current warning. See if any flags are up," Kocher said.\n\nAll of this information can be found on the National Weather Service\'s website weather.gov. It is updated each day with watches, warnings and other advisories.\n\nWhen at a beach, red flags signal hazardous conditions that would make swimming more dangerous. Yellow flags indicate rough but non-life threatening water conditions and green flags signal normal conditions.\n\n2. Keep an eye on your child\n\nWhether at the beach or pool, the National Drowning Prevention Alliance suggests parents designate a water watcher or water guardian.\n\n"Even if you are with a group of people, have one adult whose main responsibility is to keep an eye on the kids in the water," Adam Katchmarchi, the executive director of NDPA said.\n\nLifeguards should be additional, rather than sole supervisors.\n\n3. Flip, float, follow\n\nIn a water emergency, GLSRP recommends swimmers flip, float and follow.\n\nFirst flip over onto your back to float. Keep your head above the water, remain calm and conserve energy.\n\nIf in open water with a current, swim perpendicular to its flow, parallel to the shore, until you reach an area free of the current. If you see someone who appears to be drowning, toss a flotation device into the water then alert lifeguards.\n\nrcraver@wsjournal.com\n\n336-727-7376\n\n@rcraverWSJ\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'mcdowellnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'McDowellNews.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/mcdowellnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/89/d890ec13-0a60-5c3b-a47b-885b3d99fa8e/6695536e1cb52.preview.jpg?crop=860%2C452%2C0%2C51&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9735518', 'sentiment': -0.003921568627450966, 'wgt': 458759289, 'relevance': 51}

The bank\'s Paris campaign includes three ad spots centered around success stories of athletes who have graduated from the bank\'s Training Ground program to qualify for the Olympics.\n\nThe RBC Training Ground program sees the bank work with the Canadian Olympic Committee, a longtime partner, as well as 11 national sports organizations and regional sports institutes to host free events across the country where athletes aged between 14 and 25 are assessed for high-performance potential in Olympic. It\'s identified more than 1,600 athletes as having Olympic potential, and is sending a record 16 graduates of the program to the Olympics this year.\n\nThe bank\'s Paris campaign this year includes the "Hockey Here" spot which features Krissy Scurfield, a hockey player from Canmore, Alberta who attended Training Ground in 2021, and has since risen through the ranks at Rugby Canada to become an offensive threat for the women\'s 7s team. The campaign also includes "Here Together," which tells the story of Canada\'s women\'s sprint track cycling team who had never tried the sport before participating in Training Ground, including Tokyo Games gold medalist Kelsey Mitchell.\n\nA third spot, "Decathlon Here," features Pierce LePage, one of the first notable athletes to be identified through Training Ground. The spot focuses on the lifestyle of an international athlete and how it is enabled by RBC services like the international money transfer banking function on RBC\'s mobile app.\n\n"The main goal is to just do justice to the RBC Training Ground program itself, and the athletes who have put in such hard work to get to the Olympic Games," RBC senior director of brand marketing Mark Thomas says.\n\nThe campaign is part of RBC\'s partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee, which dates back to 1947. Thomas says the goal of this year\'s campaign is to take the stories of LePage and the newer athletes featured in the creative, and leverage them to bring to life RBC\'s product offerings.\n\nThomas says that the Training Ground program has been well-aligned to RBC\'s commitment to support Canadian youth by investing in the country\'s young athletes, and reshaping how athletes are recruited and developed. He adds that RBC believes its broader sponsorship strategy and Olympic partnership is aligned with its purpose to help clients thrive and communities prosper\n\n"Sport helps to build character, it teaches valuable life lessons and helps to foster healthy communities," Thomas says.\n\nDentsu and Holiday Films developed the creative for the campaign, which is tied to RBC\'s "Ideas Happen Here" platform. The campaign is airing on the CBC, Radio-Canada, Google, YouTube, Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, and all of RBC\'s owned and employee channels.', 'source': {'uri': 'strategyonline.ca', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'strategy'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://cdn.strategyonline.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/jackie-boyle-team-canada_@rileysmithphoto-622x415.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.223529411764706, 'wgt': 458757097, 'relevance': 26}

Picture: EVGENIA NOVOZHENINA/REUTERS\n\nA deal to split the assets of Russian technology company Yandex was finalised on Monday, with a Russian consortium of investors buying the bulk of Yandex\'s businesses in a cash and shares deal worth about $5.4bn.\n\nThe split marks the end of foreign ownership in Yandex, often dubbed "Russia\'s Google", potentially tightening the Kremlin\'s control of the internet space in Russia, while also finalising the largest corporate exit from Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine over two years ago.\n\nYandex\'s Dutch parent company Yandex NV (YNV) said it had sold its remaining minority 28% stake as part of the deal\'s second closing, receiving a total of $2.8bn in cash and 162.5- million YNV class A shares.\n\n"With the second closing, YNV has received the agreed upon purchase price and now fully disposed of its remaining interest in the Russian businesses," YNV said.\n\nYandex blazed a trail for Russian technology after setting up in the late 1990s dot-com boom and listing on Nasdaq, becoming a dominant force in search and advertising, ride-hailing,\n\ne-commerce and other online services.\n\nFour artificial intelligence-focused businesses in cloud, data labelling, self-driving cars and education technology are being retained by YNV and will be developed under the Nebius Group name, YNV said.\n\nYandex in Russia said YNV would stop using Yandex brands by July 31.\n\nVOLOZH RETURNS\n\nThe deal is the result of about two years of negotiations and faced various setbacks and hurdles, from Kremlin demands for a discount of at least 50% on foreign asset sales to nationalisation risk and an anti-war outburst from Yandex co-founder Arkady Volozh.\n\nAfter EU sanctions on Volozh were lifted in March, he is now set to return as CEO of Nebius and lead the renamed group, now free from the shackles of its Russia ties, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nYNV chair John Boynton thanked the company\'s 1,300 employees, paying particular tribute to Vadim Marchuk, who led the deal team.\n\n"All connections with Russia have now been severed," he said.\n\nWith the deal done, attention may turn to the future of YNV\'s Nasdaq listing, where many Western shareholders are stuck holding stakes in which trading has long been suspended.\n\n"The class A shares received as consideration will be held in treasury, pending use under our equity incentive plans and for further financing purposes," YNV said.\n\nAfter the deal\'s closing, YNV said the aggregate number of class A and Class B ordinary shares outstanding was 199-million.\n\nTrading in Yandex in Russia under the new YDEX ticker will start on July 24.\n\nThe Russian buyers said on Monday that all settlements for a share exchange, converting Moscow-listed shares in Yandex NV to the new Russian entity, MKPAO Yandex, had been completed.\n\nBut the new owners face the headache of a lawsuit filed by about 100 shareholders, accusing the consortium\'s trustee, Solid Management, of imposing discriminatory terms in the exchange of shares.', 'source': {'uri': 'businesslive.co.za', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BusinessLIVE'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GtaLWU4DXVk1iM2EyinUgwUeh0qhkof7a_1Kd2e_kQw_PJl4rVoSk2IYFONo7obZ2yINauaUg7c5Q7bN0Y5sN1NzKHyGBM2bUkodbsMtzwYl57o=s1000', 'eventUri': 'eng-9733565', 'sentiment': 0.1529411764705881, 'wgt': 458756643, 'relevance': 76}

It\'ll be back tomorrow, running Tuesday, July 16 through Wednesday, July 17.\n\nPrime Day is Amazon\'s biggest sale event of the year, when you can save big across 35 categories, from tech to home goods to clothes. Prime members can shop new deals as often as every five minutes during select periods of the event and partake in exclusive invite-only deals.\n\nAlso: The best Prime Day deals right now\n\nIn 2023, Prime members bought more than 375 million items and saved over $2.5 billion across the shopping site, the largest year on record for Amazon, according to the company. Since last July\'s Prime Day sale, the company has held a Prime Big Deal Days sale in October and, in March, promoted a Big Spring Sale for the first time. Read on for everything you need to know about this year\'s Prime Day sale, including some deals you can shop now.\n\nAlso: The best anti-Prime Day deals you can shop at Best Buy, Walmart, and beyond\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about Amazon is you don\'t have to wait until Prime Day to catch savings. Here\'s a look at some top tech deals we\'ve found scouring Amazon\'s deals page for the best savings.\n\nPrime Day is always packed with deals across every category, especially flagship Amazon products like Echo devices, Fire TVs, Kindles, and more. Amazon says shoppers can anticipate deals across 35 categories, including home, tech, and more. During October Prime Day 2023, ZDNET readers scooped up savings on Fire Sticks, AirPods, chargers, and security cameras the most, but these Prime Day sales typically include many products.\n\nAlso: The 10 most popular October Prime Day deals among ZDNET readers\n\nAmazon shared in its release that Prime members can expect to jump on back-to-school savings and college essentials, find deep discounts across the site, and find deals on "new and popular" brands only available on Amazon for the upcoming event.\n\nPrime Day not only slashes prices on many top products on Amazon (across 35 categories, to be exact), but it also sparks generous competiton amongst other major retailers such as Walmart, Target, Costco, Best Buy, and more. This means that you have a good chance of scoring a product you\'ve been eyeing for a discount of 30%, 40%, 50%, and even more at Amazon, or nabbing the very same or even better discount elsewhere.\n\nPlus, Prime Day is typically worth it for Amazon-exclusive products like Fire TVs, Fire tablets, Echo devices, Ring doorbells and cameras, Fire Sticks, and more (really, we\'re already seeing discounts of over 50% on these items). While sale periods can sometimes be tricky to know if you\'re getting the best deal, Prime Day generally does bring legitimate discounts, especially on tech. Remember, we\'re already seeing new smartphones, TVs, tablets, and more releases, which means more savings are incoming for older products.\n\nAmazon finally announced that Prime Day will return on Tuesday, July 16 and Wednesday, July 17 -- just a few weeks away. We\'ve been keeping up with all the best Prime Day news since Amazon\'s confirmation of their 10th annual Prime Day back in April, and we\'ll continue to cover all the best deals you can shop before, during, and after the popular event. Be sure to keep up with our Advice team on ZDNET.com throughout the coming weeks. We\'ll be updating the site with all the details you need to shop savvy -- including the best deals on products we\'ve personally tested and would recommend.\n\nAmazon Prime Day 2024 is slated for this upcoming July, and Amazon announced that the sale will officially run from July 16 at 12:01 a.m. PDT through July 17. Last year, Prime Day ran July 11 and 12, tailing Fourth of July weekend more closely.\n\nPrime Day 2024 will kick off on Tuesday, July 16 at 12:01 a.m. PT and will run through Wednesday, July 17. The sale will last 48 hours like in years past, though we fully expect to see a ton of deals drop before the even begins and linger for several days after. Plus, Amazon always has shoppable deals available you can explore.\n\nPrime Day is Amazon\'s most popular flagship seasonal savings event, typically in mid-July each year. Although Amazon has since branched out to add an October Prime event and other sales, this July Prime Day remains the holy grail of Amazon sales.\n\nPrime Day grants Amazon Prime members exclusive access to deals on Amazon.com across all categories, including home, tech, apparel, and more.\n\nAmazon\'s Prime Day is an exclusive sale for Amazon Prime members. You can always sign up for a 30-day free trial for those who aren\'t members. (If you\'re a student, you may be eligible for a discounted Prime Student membership, which includes a 6-month free trial.)\n\nTechnically, yes. Prime Day is an exclusive Prime members-only event. You must purchase a membership or start a free trial to participate. You can always sign up for a 30-day free trial for those who aren\'t members.\n\nLook at you, two steps ahead. Yes, there are loopholes to enjoying the Amazon sale if you aren\'t already a Prime member or don\'t want to become one permanently. A popular tactic is to sign up for a free 30-day trial, shop your favorite steals, and cancel before the 30 days are up to avoid getting charged.\n\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the US, and the UK are the participating countries.\n\nAmazon Prime costs $14.99 per month, or you can purchase an annual membership for $139, saving you a few dollars.\n\nAlso: These 5 new Amazon features make finding the products you need even easier\n\nAll college students and those aged 18-24 are eligible for a discount and can pay $7.49 per month or $69 per year. In addition, those with qualified government assistance (which may include select seniors) can receive a Prime membership for just $6.99 after their free trial.\n\nJoin Amazon Prime or start your free trial here: https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\n\nAmazon is known for its annual Prime Day event in mid-July. Prime Day began in July 2015, on the company\'s 20th birthday. However, the retail giant has recently expanded its sale periods to become more frequent. For the past two years, Amazon added a sale called Prime Big Deal Days in October, colloquially dubbed "October Prime Day." We expect the same for this year.\n\nFrom March 20-25, 2024, Amazon launched its first-ever Big Spring Sale, a sale event expected to appear again next year.\n\nIn 2020, Amazon ran its Prime Day sale event in October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in October 2022, the retail giant offered a "Prime Day Early Access" sale event, and most recently, in October 2022, Amazon ran an "October Prime Day" for the first time. Since we also saw an October Prime Day in 2023, we anticipate another Prime-related sale event will pop up in October 2024.\n\nThroughout the sale, we\'ll be extensively updating ZDNET.com live with all the best deals on products we\'ve tested and would recommend. We\'ll also curate, share, and update hand-picked lists of top deals in several product categories, including laptops, security cameras, tablets, Amazon devices, and more.\n\nAmazon also offers "Lightning Deals" during its sale events, which are time- and stock-sensitive. Look for this tag on any products you want to purchase -- if you see it, you may want to check it out -- and fast. Throughout select periods during Prime Day, new deals will continue to drop as often as every 5 minutes. Plus, invite-only deals are back. Prime members can also request an invitation to access invite-only deals -- exclusive Prime Day deals Amazon is anticipating to sell out.\n\nYes and no. While there are no live "Prime Day" deals on particular products, the retail giant shared several early offers for savings across the platform. Most are for Prime members, so you\'ll likely need to have or get a membership to access these exclusive rates. Here are a few:\n\nAlso: The best early Amazon Prime Day 2024 deals\n\nPlus, the e-commerce site regularly offers products at a discount all year round. Be sure to keep up with ZDNET.com, where we share deals every day of the week across major retailers. We also keep you posted when coveted products hit great prices.\n\nAlso: The best Amazon deals you can shop right now\n\nPrime Day brings discounts across nearly 35 categories (some of the best being in tech). There are not necessarily specific items to avoid, but remember to keep your eyes out for discounts and listing prices. Sometimes, during big savings events, it\'s hard to tell what\'s really a "discount." If you\'re checking in with all of ZDNET\'s Prime Day content, don\'t worry -- we\'ll be expert-vetting deals to ensure they\'re worth your money. If you\'re shopping on your own, make sure to do some research on historical pricing using tools like Google Shopping and more.\n\nAlso: Google expands its shopping tools just in time for Amazon Prime Day. Here\'s how to use them\n\nYes, as we\'ve seen in the past, other major retailers will undoubtedly offer competing sales, deals, and discounts. Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and other retailers try to compete with Amazon\'s Prime Day offerings, often price-cutting the same items during the same periods or extending their own sales. We\'ll cover all the best deals on top tech during Amazon\'s Prime Day event, including deals surfacing elsewhere.\n\nThe answer here is hard to say. It\'s a yes, but also a no. Invite-only Prime deals, or Lightning deals may be different each day. Amazon confirmed last month that new deals may surface as often as every five minutes on the site. As always, deals only last as long as Amazon decides, with lighting deals offering a countdown to their expiration, and other deals\' longevity pending on how fast products sell-out (or don\'t).', 'source': {'uri': 'zdnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ZDNet'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/53b1dc141683ae6bebad9141eb5001db6fbaaa9c/2024/07/01/a6e4bf81-ff71-4e67-b5e5-e70cfddf8ca3/prime-day-2024-4.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200', 'eventUri': 'eng-9731846', 'sentiment': 0.4352941176470588, 'wgt': 458752736, 'relevance': 26}

This includes Amazon Prime monthly and annual members, free trial members, and Amazon Student and Amazon Household members.\n\nStudents can get an Amazon Prime membership for 50% less - paying £4.49 per month. If students pay annually, it costs £47.49 per year, saving just over £6.\n\nWith a subscription, you get access to Prime Video, plus unlimited premium delivery, among other things.\n\nGet a free trial for Amazon Prime day\n\nIf you time it well, you can sign up 30 days of Amazon Prime for free once the Prime Day sales begin, and then cancel for free before you get charged.

The trial gets you access to Prime Video, Amazon Music, Amazon Photos and more.\n\nIf you\'re an UK undergraduate or postgraduate student, you can get six months of Amazon Prime Student for free. You\'ll need to prove your course enrollment by providing Amazon with your university email address. After the six months are up, you\'ll only have to pay half price for a Prime subscription at £4.49 per month, or £47.79 annually. To get this deal, you must be a new member. After your three years at uni, you\'ll be switched to a regular Prime subscription at £8.99 per month.\n\nTo cancel your membership before the trial expires, you\'ll need to visit the Amazon Prime membership page, choose Manage membership and select End membership.\n\nFor more advice on managing memberships, see our guide: 11 tips to save on the cost of your subscriptions.\n\nWhat if I don\'t have an Amazon Prime subscription?\n\nIn previous years, we\'ve noticed that some retailers price match Amazon Prime deals.

We found that some brands or sellers on Amazon offer rewards or incentives to buyers in an attempt to manipulate reviews and star ratings. When shopping for products on Amazon, it\'s best to read independent reviews from a variety of sources before you part with your cash".\n\n*Our nationally representative survey of 1,556 people ran in August 2023.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to spot fake reviews:\n\nIf you buy a product on Amazon Prime Day and it arrives on your doorstep damaged, the retailer is fully responsible.\n\nUnder the Consumer Rights Acts, your purchase needs to be of satisfactory quality (not faulty or damaged), fit for purpose and as described. If your Prime Day product doesn\'t meet one of these requirements, the retailer (not the manufacturer) is in breach of the Consumer Rights Act. An additional Amazon guarantee protects your purchase when buying from an Amazon marketplace - called the Amazon A-Z guarantee, it now extends to damage caused by unsafe products, too.\n\nAmazon will refund the cost of sending an item back if it was sold or dispatched by Amazon. If the item you purchased isn\'t eligible for a free return, and you\'re using a pre-paid return label, Amazon will deduct the cost of the return from your refund.\n\nFor expert advice on returning goods you\'ve bought online, see our in-depth guide to returns and refunds.\n\nHow to recycle your old tech\n\nIf you\'re looking to replace some older technology by shopping the Prime Day sale, make sure you dispose of your old items in a responsible way.\n\nYou have a few options if you want to offload your unwanted electronics. Kerbside collection is suitable for small electrical items - in many cases, your local council will collect smaller items such as toasters and kettles. Alternatively, you can drop items at a local recycling centre.\n\nFor more details on how to get rid of your unused gadgets, check our advice on how to recycle electrical items.', 'source': {'uri': 'which.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Which?'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://media.product.which.co.uk/prod/images/ar_2to1_1500x750/d1189fb6d63f-prime-day-lead.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9731846', 'sentiment': 0.4980392156862745, 'wgt': 458751511, 'relevance': 54}

By Alexander Marrow\n\nA deal to split the assets of Russian technology company Yandex was finalised on Monday, with a Russian consortium of investors buying the bulk of Yandex\'s businesses in a cash and shares deal worth around $5.4 billion.\n\nThe split marks the end of foreign ownership in Yandex, often dubbed "Russia\'s Google", potentially tightening the Kremlin\'s control of the internet space in Russia, while also finalising the largest corporate exit from Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine over two years ago.\n\nYandex\'s Dutch parent company Yandex NV (YNV) said it had sold its remaining minority 28% stake as part of the deal\'s second closing, receiving a total of $2.8 billion in cash and 162.5 million YNV class A shares.\n\n"With the second closing, YNV has received the agreed upon purchase price and now fully disposed of its remaining interest in the Russian businesses," YNV said.\n\nYandex blazed a trail for Russian technology after setting up in the late 1990s dotcom boom and listing on Nasdaq, becoming a dominant force in search and advertising, ride-hailing, e-commerce and other online services.\n\nFour AI-focused businesses in cloud, data labelling, self-driving cars and education technology are being retained by YNV and will be developed under the Nebius Group name, YNV said.\n\nYandex in Russia said YNV would stop using Yandex brands by July 31.\n\nVOLOZH RETURNS\n\nThe deal is the result of around two years of negotiations and faced various setbacks and hurdles, from Kremlin demands for a discount of at least 50% on foreign asset sales to nationalisation risk and an anti-war outburst from Yandex co-founder Arkady Volozh.\n\nAfter EU sanctions on Volozh were lifted in March, he is now set to return as CEO of Nebius and lead the renamed group, now free from the shackles of its Russia ties, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nYNV Chairman John Boynton thanked the company\'s 1,300 employees, paying particular tribute to Vadim Marchuk, who led the deal team.\n\n"All connections with Russia have now been severed," he said.\n\nWith the deal done, attention may turn to the future of YNV\'s Nasdaq listing, where many Western shareholders are stuck holding stakes in which trading has long been suspended.\n\n"The Class A shares received as consideration will be held in treasury, pending use under our equity incentive plans and for further financing purposes," YNV said.\n\nFollowing the deal\'s closing, YNV said the aggregate number of Class A and Class B ordinary shares outstanding was 199 million.\n\nTrading in Yandex in Russia under the new YDEX ticker will start on July 24.\n\nThe Russian buyers said on Monday that all settlements for a share exchange, converting Moscow-listed shares in Yandex NV to the new Russian entity, MKPAO Yandex, had been completed.\n\nBut the new owners face the headache of a lawsuit filed by around 100 shareholders, accusing the consortium\'s trustee, Solid Management, of imposing discriminatory terms in the exchange of shares.', 'source': {'uri': 'telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ETTelecom.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-111760617,imgsize-63080,width-1200,height=765,overlay-ettelecom/internet/yandex-split-finalised-as-russian-assets-sold-in-5-4-bln-deal.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9733565', 'sentiment': 0.2784313725490195, 'wgt': 458751038, 'relevance': 76}

Individual gear pieces will mostly have basic stats, but individual pieces can be equipped with mods to boost different stats, while sets can be found and worn to give greater bonuses to players.\n\nGetting the benefits of gear sets can greatly strengthen the player, but this will force the character to look a specific way. Luckily, players in Once Human can change the appearance of gear pieces or even hide gear's appearance to fully customize how their player looks while still wearing the best gear for their build.\n\nRelated\n\nOnce Human: How To Access Rift Anchor\n\nRift Anchors can be found in most major locations in Once Human; here's how to access and use them.\n\nHow To Modify Gear In Once Human\n\nClose\n\nAs players explore abandoned structures and fight powerful monsters, they will often get gear mods as loot. Gear mods are a set bonus that can be applied to any piece of gear as long as that gear piece is the same tier as the mode. Gear mods can be placed on gear at any time by hovering over a gear piece in the menu and right-clicking to open up the mod menu. Next to the name of the gear piece will be its tier level, indicating which mods can be equipped on it.\n\nGear mods can be taken off and put on other gear pieces without any cost or penalties, letting players mix and match as often as they want to try out different options. There are no negative effects to using mods, so mix and match your mods to find the best ones to complement the guns you crafted.\n\nRelated\n\nOnce Human: Best Weapons, Ranked\n\nOnce Human has a wide choice of weapons available for players, covering all playstyles from melee combat to sniping.\n\nHow To Change Gear Appearance In Once Human\n\nClose\n\nSome gear pieces in Once Human may have great stats but don't look the best. When hovering over gear in the gear menu, pressing V will hide that gear piece on the player. This is especially helpful for those who want to hide any hats, helmets, or masks to see the character they created. Players can also use the Fashion menu to permanently set the appearance of a gear item on their character.\n\nThese cosmetics can be earned in a few different ways:\n\nComplete Active Events Purchased in the shop using Crystgin Obtained from the battle pass Found in seasonal crates\n\nCosmetics can come as individuals, letting players mix and match to make their character look however they want. Equipping cosmetics is done on the cosmetic screen, going to each gear slot individually and picking the cosmetic item for that slot. Once a cosmetic is set in the Fashion menu, the player's appearance won't change if they change gear, and will only change if they return to the Fashion menu and take off the cosmetic. There are also premium costumes that change the loot of all gear slots, but these are much rarer and cost more when purchasing them in the shop.\n\nOnce Human\n\nSystem PC , Mobile , Google , Apple\n\nPlatform(s) PC , Android , iOS\n\nReleased July 9, 2024\n\nDeveloper(s) Starry Studio\n\nPublisher(s) Starry Studio , NetEase, Inc.", 'source': {'uri': 'gamerant.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Game Rant'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'joshua_leeds@gamerant.com', 'name': 'Joshua Leeds', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fes-28.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2941176470588236, 'wgt': 458748890, 'relevance': 9}

Arenas agreed with most of Chapman\'s comments and added that white American players are dissuaded by their parents to play basketball, and are being coddled, unlike players in Europe.\n\n"This is great information... We know the white Americans got pushed out of the NBA and the Euro took over white America. That\'s who is the new white person. No one really explained what happened to the white American (player)... White parents were discouraging their kids from going down this road in sports..."\n\n"Watching AAU, it\'s true. I don\'t know what a parent is telling their kids. When the player doesn\'t play, or the coach is yelling at a player, those parents transfer... Kids are not being coached anymore. They are being coddled... That sh*t is hurting a group of people."\n\n"You\'re taking away competitive (spirit) so they\'re not being competitive anymore... When you go overseas, it\'s \'F*ck you!\'. They don\'t care about nothing. The coach hits you, spits on you, do all that. You learn tough skin from an early age. Here you yell at a kid too loud and he cries, trust me he ain\'t coming back next week."\n\n(0:23 onwards)\n\nArenas clearly has some firsthand experience watching AAU basketball and doesn\'t like how players have become soft. While players have the right to pick where they want to play, their shying away from competition and aggression from their coaches is not a good sign for those wanting to see more white American players in the NBA.\n\nWhite American Players Are Rare In The NBA\n\nUnlike years past, the white Americans in the NBA are few and far between. This isn\'t to say that there aren\'t talented white American players in the league. Players like Chet Holmgren, Austin Reaves, Tyler Herro, and Donte DiVincenzo are in the league and playing important roles on their respective teams.\n\nBut now, it is primarily the European white players that are finding success in the NBA. Stars like Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Lauri Markkanen have become some of the biggest names in the league, and are incredibly popular among fans.\n\nNBA fans aren\'t likely to be concerned about the white American players\' declining presence in the NBA, as the quality of the sport and players are still very high. And as things stand, there haven\'t been any notable barriers to entry for white American players in the league.\n\nCould we see a re-emergence of white American stars in the NBA? It is hard to predict, but considering basketball is more popular among people of color in the United States, there seems to be less motivation from white American families to introduce their kids to basketball.\n\nHowever, nothing can be ruled out, and maybe a young white American star could inspire others to dedicate themselves to the sport and become successful in the league.\n\nRelated: The 10 Best White NBA Players For The 2023-24 Season\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

There were plenty of kids playing on the playground, but he was the only one keen on earning the title of Mullet Champ in the USA Mullet Championships.\n\n"There\'s a lot of spikes. Last year and this year I\'ve been doing a lot of spikes," he said of his mullet. "I think I\'ve got about a 50% chance to win the competition."\n\nVerzani isn\'t sporting the haircut some call a Kentucky Waterfall just to turn heads and get compliments. The USA Mullet Championships are part of a fundraiser for Jared Allen\'s Homes for Wounded Warriors. The group\'s mission is to provide veterans who were wounded in combat with an accessible, mortgage-free, injury-specific home, according to its website.\n\nIn a family full of military veterans, that\'s an easy cause to get behind.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCaribou Coffee to open new location in Mooresville Monday Letter: Too much development is destroying Mooresville Silver Alert canceled on woman, 87, from Mooresville 3 from South Carolina die in Nebo NC plane crash; national safety board investigating North Carolina Public health restaurant and food-stand inspections in Iredell County, June 28-July 11 Perfect timing: Residents elect Town of Mooresville\'s fourth dog mayor Trump injured but \'fine\' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Iredell EMS deputy director talks about his termination.

Honestly, it fits his personality," Samantha said. "He\'s very mischievous, quick-witted, and fun-loving, and goes with the flow. But it very much suits his personality."\n\nThe mischievous part was evident as Luke crawled on top of the playground equipment in Troutman, testing his mother\'s patience.\n\nMullet Champ\n\nThe USA Mullet Championships are a national competition where haircuts like Luke\'s are judged by three things: online votes, judges, and money raised for Jared Allen\'s Homes for Wounded Warriors.\n\nThose wanting to vote for Luke and donate to his cause can go to mulletchamp.com/mullets and search for Luke.\n\nContestants are separated into different age groups, with Luke competing against other kids ages 8-12.\n\nThe opening round of qualification voting continues until July 17. If enough fans vote and enough money is raised, Luke will advance to round 2, which is July 24-30. In the final round, the top hairdos are judged by professional motocross athlete Aaron Plessinger and "The Pat McAfee Show" co-host Boston Connor.

"Thank you for sharing and raising awareness."\n\n"As someone who has experienced anxiety alongside driving for many years this is so important!" yet another user added.\n\nJulie\'s first experience of menopause driving fear began two years ago and has now stopped her from driving in rush hour traffic, forcing her to find alternative transport to get to work.\n\n"They don\'t tell you how most symptoms of menopause can change your life, but I never expected this, to be scared behind the wheel of my own car," the 57-year-old told Nationwide Vehicle Contracts.\n\n"I live in a quiet town, where we don\'t even get much traffic, but I now avoid driving in rush hour and driving any long journeys as it scares the life out of me - even the smallest thing like someone overtaking me can shake me up and I find myself not wanting to drive.\n\n"I\'m now on HRT, but I\'ve been nervous about driving now for two years, so I worry the fear won\'t ever change."\n\nSo what\'s causing this seemingly irrational fear of getting behind the wheel?\n\nIntimate health and hormone expert Dr Shirin Lakhani says many women going through the menopause don\'t just experience physical changes, but mental ones, too.\n\nDue to hormone levels fluctuating during perimenopause and menopause, Dr Lakhani says what were once simple, everyday tasks can turn into something more daunting.\n\n"Driving anxiety can often occur for those with anxious tendencies, which can of course be exaggerated during menopause," she explains. "Many have anxiety surrounding it due to the danger you are putting yourself in when driving. And although for most people they don\'t feel too worried about it, during menopause anxieties can increase about everything, even the things we once thought little of."\n\nBut there are other factors at play, aside from anxiety.\n\n"Menopause affects the nervous system, potentially impacting reaction times, balance, and overall coordination," explains Kate Toby, health and wellness expert at Zego Car Insurance. "These physical changes can make women feel less in control and more vulnerable on the road."\n\nThere\'s also often an increased awareness of ageing and mortality.\n\n"This heightened awareness can contribute to a general sense of vulnerability and fear, including when driving," she continues.\n\nAnd having a sudden loss of confidence behind the wheel can also contribute.\n\n"Menopause can lead to a decline in self-confidence. Everyday activities, including driving, may feel more daunting, and the fear of making mistakes or having an accident can become more pronounced," XX adds.\n\nContinuously driving, even for short distances, helps maintain and build confidence. "Avoiding driving can worsen anxiety, so regular practice is essential," Toby explains.\n\nMindfulness and relaxation techniques\n\nPracticing mindfulness, deep breathing, and other relaxation techniques can help manage anxiety. "These methods can be particularly useful before and during driving," Toby explains.\n\nHealthy lifestyle choices\n\nToby suggests maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting adequate sleep can positively impact overall health and reduce anxiety levels.\n\nShare the journey\n\nHaving a confident driver in the passenger seat while you\'re driving can also help to ease discomfort. "They may help to calmly direct you to your destination, offer encouragement whilst navigating traffic and roundabouts, or even just be a comforting ear to vent to," explains an expert from Nationwide Vehicle Contracts.\n\nProfessional support\n\nSeeking support from a therapist or counsellor can provide strategies to manage anxiety. "Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), in particular, can be effective in addressing specific fears related to driving," Toby adds.\n\nDriving courses\n\nEnrolling in a refresher driving course can help regain confidence and improve driving skills. "These courses offer practical advice and provide a safe environment to practice driving," Toby says.\n\nOpen communication\n\nDiscussing fears and anxieties with family and friends can provide emotional support. "Sometimes, just talking about these concerns can alleviate some of the stress associated with driving," Toby explains.\n\n"By understanding these contributing factors and implementing practical strategies, women can regain their driving confidence and continue to navigate the roads safely and comfortably during menopause," she adds.\n\nMenopause: Read more', 'source': {'uri': 'uk.style.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'marie_claire_dorking@uk.style.yahoo.com', 'name': 'Marie-Claire Dorking', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hn8BfTFM5F0zFL.nHs89Sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/3f8d7590-3f7a-11ef-bdd5-0300d1285320', 'eventUri': 'eng-9731435', 'sentiment': -0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 458739209, 'relevance': 60}

Here is what the advanced stats teach us.', 'body': 'Led by former collegiate rivals Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark, this is a particularly special group of rookies in the WNBA.\n\nAs we approach the upcoming WNBA All-Star Game, where the two will play alongside one another, we have some time to sit back and reflect on what these two have accomplished at this point in their professional careers.\n\nNot only have the players helped grow the game in incredible ways with countless new fans from around the world, but they have both impressed on the court as well. They are both worth turning on the TV whenever they have games scheduled.\n\nClark (-100) is currently the heavy favorite to win the 2024 WNBA Rookie of the Year, per BetMGM. Her heavy implied probability suggests that it is unlikely anyone else gets the award.\n\nBut is that a disservice to Reese, an underdog (+500) whose implied probability of 20.0 percent suggests she is still a legitimate candidate?\n\nThe Rookie of the Year campaigns for Clark and Reese\n\nWhile there is a lot of intrigue around the WNBA\'s Rookie of the Year this season, many fans and media members may hold some form of biases based on preconceived notions of Reese and Clark.\n\nSo we wanted to bring some numbers into the mix using advanced stats known as catch-all or all-in-one metrics. These are basically a single number that attempts to evaluate, on various scales, the success of a basketball player on a court. It\'s like the film (and book!) Moneyball but for the hardwood.\n\nThe WNBA\'s Rookie of the Year isn\'t just based on stats, of course, or the league would have the decision made by a machine. Evaluators have several factors to consider, but the numbers can and should play a role.\n\nBased on the advanced analytics made evaluable to us, similar to what we have done in the NBA, we created a bit of a rudimentary model that could help make a determination.\n\nI\'ve written about these stats in the NBA and they\'re very useful and worth citing during player evaluations. But they do have shortcomings worth noting. For example, one particularly relevant note is that post players tend to perform better than high-usage guards due to efficiency.\n\nWe can look back at these scores later in the season to track progress.\n\nRELATED: Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese are neck and neck for Rookie of The Year\n\nThe results\n\nUsing the metrics that are publicly available, here is how the top rookies performed across each measurement. It is enjoyable and informative to look at just to compare overall productivity. We included the top performers, but there are other notable rookies who could appear on these leaderboards later.\n\nBold indicates that they lead all first-year players in that stat:\n\nNAME Estimated Contributions Estmated Win Probability Added Player Efficiency Rating Player Impact Estimate RAM RAPTOR Win Shares Angel Reese 0.1 0.5 19.2 13.3 7.7 2.04 2.6 Caitlin Clark -1.2 0.1 17.1 12.4 8.2 -0.28 1.3 Leonie Fiebich 0.9 0.3 10.3 5.9 4.9 -0.41 1.1 Aaliyah Edwards -1.9 0.4 14.1 10.1 6.0 -2.35 1.1 Rickea Jackson -2.1 0.7 11.6 7.2 6.0 -4.65 0.4 Kamilla Cardoso -1.5 -0.1 14.1 8.8 5.8 -3.88 0.9\n\nHowever, because not all statistics are created equally, we included a few more steps.\n\nWe also adjusted for playing time to avoid small size concerns and later standardized each metric using something called a Z-Score. The numbers below suggest how much better than average each player is at each metric relative to the entire WNBA.\n\nFor example, Reese\'s Z-Score for PER (Player Efficiency Rating) is 1.56 right now. That means when adjusted for playing time, her PER is currently more than 1.5 standard deviations above the mode of the average WNBA player for this season.\n\nHer average Z-Score across all these metrics is 1.04, the leader among all rookies. Here is the basic math:\n\nNAME AVERAGE EC eWPA PER PIE RAM RAPTOR WS Angel Reese 1.04 0.02 0.28 1.56 1.60 1.29 0.94 1.58 Caitlin Clark 0.57 -1.04 -0.35 1.52 1.69 1.74 -0.15 0.58 Leonie Fiebich -0.14 0.34 -0.29 -0.24 -0.35 -0.23 -0.13 -0.11 Aaliyah Edwards -0.20 -0.95 -0.18 0.15 0.23 0.06 -0.71 -0.07 Rickea Jackson -0.34 -1.31 0.36 0.21 0.11 0.37 -1.76 -0.40 Kamilla Cardoso -0.37 -0.71 -0.60 0.06 -0.01 -0.06 -1.08 -0.21\n\nAll statistics are accurate as of July 12, 2024.\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\nAs of right now, this study says Reese is clearly the top rookie this season. She was also the only first-year WNBA player who performed better than average across every advanced metric.\n\nIn fact, her overall score would currently make her one of the top-25 most positively impactful players in the WNBA so far season. While our methods were very different than what was recently used by Neil Paine for ESPN, the results were fairly similar.\n\nThis likely suggests that if you look solely at trusted advanced analytics for this decision, Reese is the pick. But as we know, for many, the decision will include more factors than that.\n\nThere is still plenty of time left in the season for players to make their case.\n\nRELATED: Angel Reese has taken over the WNBA Rookie of the Year race\n\nMore about the methodology\n\nThis used a methodology suggested by Owen Phillips, who now works in the front office for the New York Knicks. But the idea was simple: Find all of the advanced metrics you like and put them on a spreadsheet.\n\nThis next part is going to sound like a lot math, but it\'s actually fairly simple if you know how to Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.\n\nHowever, if all of this begins to sound like a whole lot of numbers, worry not. Instead, just look at the "score" for a clean metric that summarizes the overall productivity of a player.\n\nBased on a tip from another individual who works in a front office for an NBA team, we adjusted for playing time by multiplying their impact contribution on each metric by the percentage of possible minutes they have played for their team so far this season.\n\nWe standardized each score by finding the Z-score for each player in each metric. The Z-score measures how many standard deviations from the mean for each data point. If a Z-score is 0, that means the player is exactly league average.\n\nAs the last step, we took the average Z-score that a player had across each metric.\n\nMore details about the metrics Estimated Contributions | Positive Residual | MORE INFO Expected Wins Probability Added (eWPA) | inpredictable | MORE INFO Player Efficiency Rating (PER) | HerHoopStats | MORE INFO Player Impact Estimate (PIE) | WNBA.com | MORE INFO RAPTOR (Estimated) | Neil\'s Substack | MORE INFO RAM | Cerebro Sports | MORE INFO Win Shares (WS) | HerHoopStats | MORE INFO Cierra Burdick: 5 facts about the veteran for the USA 3x3 women\'s basketball team at the Olympics Caitlin Clark gave a young Fever fan the game shoes off her feet after victory against Lynx Caitlin Clark gave a delightfully droll response to question on getting closer to rookie assists record in Minneapolis Caitlin Clark got the traveling Fever fans to their feet in Minnesota right before massive win Caitlin Clark crossed up Lynx\'s Bridget Carleton on the way to this ankle-breaking layup', 'source': {'uri': 'ftw.usatoday.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'For The Win'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'bryan_kalbrosky@ftw.usatoday.com', 'name': 'Bryan Kalbrosky', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/07/2157848123-e1720799593978.jpg?w=640', 'eventUri': 'eng-9727976', 'sentiment': 0.4274509803921569, 'wgt': 458739197, 'relevance': 26}

Actually, no: the 2020 Games were held in 2021 due to the pandemic (extra points if you remember where). The 2024 Olympics will be upon us shortly. These events have captivated me since I was young.\n\nI remember Bob Beamon\'s long jump record, which we measured off in my sixth-grade classroom. It was an incredible feat that wasn\'t equaled for another 50-some years. In those same Mexico City Games I also remember the raised fists of Tommie Smith and John Carlos on the medal stand, denoting black power and unity, a controversy representing the intersection of athletics and political protest which I\'m sure will be echoed this year.\n\nI prefer to focus on the athletics, especially since many of the competitors participate in sports that get little, if any, recognition. Trial competitions have been ongoing, with swimming, track and field, and gymnastics being televised. My son was a competitive swimmer and I will testify to long, twice daily practices for years, before and after school and on weekends. It\'s what helped me realize how much time and effort goes into these endeavors.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I tried the balance beam in high school and twisted an ankle falling off after a couple steps.\n\nSome of our most well-known athletes, particularly from the women\'s team, compete in solo and team events. This year we\'ll see Simone Biles again, who made the decision to withdraw in 2021 after suffering disorientation in the air during the vault event. I hope she does well this time, and never understood the criticism she endured after placing her mental health first.\n\nThen there are the sports I think of as more professional endeavors- basketball, golf, tennis, etc. At least now our professional athletes can compete, not amateurs facing professionals masquerading as amateurs on the Soviet or East German teams. I\'ll never forget the controversial 1972 basketball final, where questionable refereeing led to decisions that handed the gold medal to the Soviets. The second-place silver medals are still in a vault, as the American team refused them and did not attend the medal ceremony.\n\nAs for so many other sports - rhythm gymnastics, synchronized swim, dressage, archery, shooting, trampoline, sailing, badminton, and others - some heretofore unknowns will have their moment in the sun, as they stand on the medal platform and hear their country\'s national anthem. We\'ll never know their names, but they\'ll always be winners.\n\nI plan to be ensconced on my couch, competing for the gold in prolonged butt-planting, as soon as the booming opening drums of the Olympic theme are heard.\n\n0 Comments Catch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'buffalonews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Buffalo News'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/fd/7fd18826-4060-11ef-882e-1f8c0efd3f0a/66914b3ef0f64.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.08235294117647052, 'wgt': 458735425, 'relevance': 26}

NASCAR is also preparing for a new era next year with the start of a new media rights cycle, all factors that appear to be contributing to NASCAR\'s latest moves.\n\nAfter 30 years of service to NASCAR and International Speedway Corp., NASCAR\'s executive vice president and chief revenue officer, Daryl Wolfe, told colleagues this month he will retire after the 2024 season. NASCAR also recently let go multiple salespeople under Wolfe and, in a move that came several months ago, quietly hired Denver-based brand consultancy Monigle to change how the company goes to the market overall, including in the sponsorship space.\n\nXfinity and Geico, two of NASCAR\'s four premier partners, are said to be in renewal discussions, while a third, Coca-Cola, has been making changes to its deal. NASCAR is looking for a fifth premier partner, soures said, in what would be the first new brand to come in at that level since the system debuted in 2020. Moreover, it\'s looking to fill smaller deals in a host of open categories, including technology.\n\nTaken together, there\'s a lot going on for NASCAR, and top brass appear determined to get more aggressive in driving revenue.\n\n"If, as a league, they don\'t evolve and grow with the way the marketplace is going, then they\'re going to fall behind," said Kami Taylor, executive vice president of experiential at Octagon, which works with several brands in NASCAR. "However, I think the overall health of NASCAR is strong and they still provide robust sponsorship opportunities for brands looking to grow regionally or domestically."\n\nNASCAR officials declined to comment.\n\nSponsorship has been a part of the 76-year-old sport for decades to defray the cost of running a race team and the league. Over time, that formula -- combined with the massive fan base that NASCAR developed -- helped turn NASCAR into a marketing and licensing powerhouse. But following the 2008 financial crisis, sponsorship started to dry up relative to its peak.\n\nJust as NASCAR was switching to its new premier partner system in 2020, Formula 1 grew its popularity immensely through the opportunely timed Netflix series "Drive to Survive," which got many Americans into the sport while they were stuck at home during pandemic lockdowns. Corporate partners quickly followed, and 2021 and 2022 were filled with announcements from brands based in the U.S. getting into F1 for the first time or renewing. In 2024, roughly 75% of all technology-related sponsors in F1 -- including team sponsors -- are American companies, according to Spomotion Analytics, with more than 40 from the U.S. compared to just six from Europe. That includes Amazon, Google, Microsoft, American Express, Oracle, Visa, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard, Cash App and Meta\'s WhatsApp messaging platform.\n\nIn 2023, NASCAR said it added seven official sponsors, and it\'s added two more this year. Brands added since 2023 include FanDuel, Powerball, Hard Rock Bet, ABB, Cabo Wabo tequila, RTIC coolers, Leidos, Ally Financial and Liquid Death.\n\nWhen NASCAR moved to the premier partner system for its top Cup Series, it asked around $15 million annually over three- to five-year terms for those positions, sources said at the time, but it was unclear how much incremental revenue NASCAR saw because the four brands that signed on were already official partners. On top of Xfinity, Geico and Coke, the fourth premier partner is Anheuser-Busch\'s Busch Light brand.\n\nNASCAR has looked into landing a fifth premier partner and doing so would ensure that the racing property would still have at least four if one of the original partners left.\n\nXfinity became title sponsor of NASCAR\'s second-level series in 2015 as part of a corporate synergy strategy from Comcast, whose NBC Sports began broadcasting NASCAR races that year. Matt Lederer, Comcast\'s vice president of branded partnerships and activation, has said Xfinity is in renewal talks with NASCAR. But the company wants to shake up the terms of its agreement, be more flexible with its spending and possibly redirect some of its league-level spending to other parts of the NASCAR industry, such as its team relationship with 23XI Racing.\n\nXfinity Mobile is a key product for Comcast and figures to be an important part of the next deal. Xfinity currently spends more than $10 million in the sport annually, all told, according to sources. The major question is whether Comcast will continue being both a premier partner of NASCAR and title sponsor of the Xfinity Series. Sources say it\'s possible Xfinity could do a short-term renewal as title sponsor before shifting its relationship in the coming years to just being a premier partner.\n\nGeico also is said to be in renewal discussions, and industry executives have waffled all year on whether the Berkshire Hathaway-owned insurer will renew. The company has had a multitude of executive and agency changes in recent years, which often equals change in sports marketing deals.\n\nMeanwhile, Coke\'s deal is expected to continue next year, but the company has been making changes to its asset mix, sources say. Some NASCAR-owned tracks have started selling their soda rights to other brands -- such as Kansas Speedway having 7UP sponsorship at its race this year -- which shows how Coca-Cola has changed some of its asset mix.\n\nThe new structure of NASCAR\'s sales team and whether NASCAR will hire a new CRO to directly replace Wolfe was unclear. Taylor, the Octagon executive, recommended that NASCAR continue to partner with teams on sponsorship packages to make deals "one larger package instead of just disparate pieces from an asset perspective." The sport has improved its cool factor since the pandemic, and Taylor noted that should help the company find new sponsors.\n\n"That does help, because now they have got a different product than they had before to go out and sell with," Taylor said.', 'source': {'uri': 'sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'sportsbusinessjournal.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'adam_stern@sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'name': 'Adam Stern', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/-/media/Images/Journal/2024/07/15/pg-08-NASCAR-Matchbox-20-Rob-Thomas-at-Coca-Cola-600_Getty.ashx', 'eventUri': 'eng-9737592', 'sentiment': 0.1294117647058823, 'wgt': 458734581, 'relevance': 51}

Google Cloud este dedicat să contribuie la creșterea adoptării tehnologiilor cloud și la facilitarea serviciilor publice digitale inovatoare, în conformitate cu obiectivele României de transformare digitală și cu țintele Deceniului Digital al Europei pentru 2030", a declarat Thomas Kurian, CEO al Google Cloud, potrivit Executivului.\n\nReprezentanții Google și-au reafirmat, de asemenea, sprijinul pentru a contribui la creșterea rezilienței cibernetice a structurilor guvernamentale prin schimbul de bune practici, consolidarea competențelor digitale de bază și avansate și adoptarea tehnologiilor de cloud computing.\n\nAceastă colaborare vizează utilizarea tehnologiilor moderne precum Inteligența Artificială, îmbunătățirea eficienței operaționale, îmbunătățirea experiențelor cetățenilor, sporirea securității digitale a Guvernului și promovarea inovației în sectorul public.\n\n"Avem proiecte ambițioase de reformă a administrației publice, care implică utilizarea tehnologiilor moderne precum Inteligența Artificială, îmbunătățirea eficienței operaționale, creșterea securității digitale, promovarea inovației în sectorul public și adoptarea cloud-ului. Avansăm în ceea ce privește transformarea digitală a serviciilor publice, suntem în linie dreaptă cu modernizarea sistemului fiscal pentru detectarea fraudelor și creșterea colectării, iar fiecare zi ne arată cât este de importantă creșterea rezilienței cibernetice. De asemenea, ne-am asumat operaționalizarea cloud-ului guvernamental. Expertiza și contribuția Google sunt esențiale pentru a pune în practică servicii publice performante și sigure pentru români", a afirmat premierul Marcel Ciolacu.\n\nPrim-ministrul a subliniat că România este o piață atractivă pentru investitorii din domeniul tehnologiei informațiilor, atât prin oportunitatea proiectelor majore în centre de date și servicii de cloud, cât și datorită specialiștilor cu înaltă formare profesională și a legislației avansate.\n\n"Inteligența artificială și celelalte tehnologii emergente se bazează pe infrastructuri digitale de tip cloud pentru a deveni un sprijin esențial pentru utilizatori. România are o șansă fantastică de a se dezvolta prin tehnologiile viitorului. Vom avea rezultate pentru că punem la aceeași masă cei mai buni specialiști români și expertiza giganților globali din IT. Împreună, ducem România la următorul nivel!", a declarat și ministrul Digitalizării, Bgdan Ivan.\n\nGigantul american Google ar putea investi într-un centru de date care să fie deschis în România peste 2 miliarde de dolari, au declarat anterior surse guvernamentale. În cadrul negocierilor, Guvernul insistă ca viitorul centru de date să aibă un rol regional.\n\nDe ce este important: Premierul Ciolacu a discutat anul trecut cu conducerea Google chiar în SUA despre înființarea acestui centru, iar apoi discuțiile au continuat și la București.\n\n"Un data center în România. Cred ca suntem cei mai îndreptățiți să avem acest lucru. Microsoft cred că are aproape 5.000 de angajați în România, Google vreo 500. Cunoaștem cu toții ce înseamnă un data center pe teritoriul României? Extraordinar de mult! Reprezentanții Google mi-au spus că România are o resursă umană uriașă în domeniul IT, specialiștii noștri fiind printre cei mai bine cotați pe plan mondial. Sunt convins că, folosind talentul lor și expertiza de top a Google, vom reuși să demarăm cele mai ambițioase proiecte în zona noilor tehnologii. Mai mult, vom da astfel un semnal clar și altor mari companii din IT care vor să se extindă în Europa de Est că aici, în România, găsesc oportunități excelente de dezvoltare a afacerilor", spunea Ciolacu în SUA.\n\nRecent, surse guvernamentale arătau că negocierile pentru acest centru de date sunt în curs, iar investiția va depăși 2 miliarde de dolari.\n\nAcest lucru însemană că un posibil centru de date local va rivaliza cu cel din Polonia, în care, în urmă cu patru ani, Google a decis că va investi până la 2 miliarde de dolari, pentru a extinde prezența companiei pe segmentul serviciilor de cloud computing.\n\nGoogle a anunțat atunci că vrea să creeze o "regiune Google Cloud", iar directorul general, Sundar Pichai, a dezvăluit și un plan de investiții de 3 miliarde de dolari în extinderea centrelor de date din Europa într-un orizont de doi ani.\n\nSurse guvermentale arată de altfel că România insistă ca noul centru să aibă un astfel de rol regional.\n\nÎn România, Google Bucharest SRL, filiala Google în România, a fost inclusă în 2016 de Fisc pe lista companiilor din industria online investigate deoarece continua să raporteze un profit de sub 2 milioane lei.\n\nVeniturile Google în Romania erau estimate însă în piață la 75-100 milioane de euro anual, în principal din publicitate.', 'source': {'uri': 'profit.ro', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Profit.ro'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://i0.1616.ro/media/2/2621/34129/21668958/2/google.jpg?width=640', 'eventUri': 'eng-9738070', 'sentiment': 0.05098039215686279, 'wgt': 458734109, 'relevance': 125}

"Taylor Swift concert ready by 2028," the now-viral slide boldly claimed.\n\nBut it went viral for another reason too: the stadium shown in the slide looked awfully similar to a new sports arena in San Diego, California.\n\nA photo of the slide was initially reported online in a now-deleted post on X. Since then, it has been shared and reposted thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter. The slide features a dimmed background, seemingly a conceptual rendering of an arena complex. Although the slide discussed the planned stadium in Clark, it did not explicitly state that the image depicted the actual project.\n\nAnd it certainly didn\'t. A quick Google reverse image search showed that it was actually a conceptual rendering of "Midway Rising," a 48-acre development in San Diego that includes a sports arena. The project is designed by Safdie Rabines Architects, and the architectural firm has on their website a conceptual rendering similar to what was used in the CIAC\'s slide.\n\nAfter facing backlash online for using the image without attribution, CIAC quickly released a statement claiming "there was no copyright infringement intended."\n\n"CIAC is proud to conceive of this project with the inspiration of the likes of the rising San Diego Sports Arena in California, as presented at the second Clark Technical Working Group (TWG) on the Enhancement of the Utilization of Clark International Airport (CRK) meeting. There was no copyright infringement intended in the course of presenting the benchmarks of our project development process to like minds and peers among national leaders and private sector stakeholders," the CIAC said in a post on Saturday, July 13.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Tourism (DOT) was also quick to clear its name, clarifying that they were not involved in the CIAC\'s presentation or plans.\n\n"The DOT wishes to clarify erroneous information circulating online wrongly attributing to the DOT and Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco the imagery used in the presentation of CIAC President Arrey Perez for the Clark Complex in Pampanga. Neither the DOT nor Secretary Frasco were involved in the creation or delivery of these plans made and presented by Mr. Perez," the DOT said in a statement posted an hour before CIAC\'s.\n\nApparently, the now-viral slide was shown during a TWG meeting, which happened to include other high-level government officials, such as Tourism Secretary Frasco.\n\n"On his own accord, CIAC President Arrey Perez gave a presentation on his future plans for the Clark Complex, including a proposal to construct a facility capable of hosting major events such as concerts," the DOT added. "The DOT has requested the CIAC to confirm that neither the DOT nor the Secretary has any involvement in their plans and presentation."\n\nAnd sure enough, that\'s what CIAC did.\n\n"We are grateful to the Department of Tourism - Philippines for their unequivocal support for Clark and in giving us the creative freedom, as they had no hand in developing the viral deck, to present our vision for the performance arena," the government corporation said.\n\nEven with these early issues aside, the stadium still has a long way to go before being realized. It\'s just one part of a 37-hectare Entertainment and Events Center near the Clark International Airport, which will be developed through a public-private partnership from 2024 to 2027. While CIAC President Perez said that there are already at least three interested private sector partners, nothing is final yet.\n\nLet\'s hope the final stadium comes out better than this shaky start - or as Taylor would say, CIAC needs to shake it off! - Rappler.com', 'source': {'uri': 'rappler.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Rappler'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/07/taylor-swift-ready-stadium.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9728853', 'sentiment': 0.1372549019607843, 'wgt': 458733944, 'relevance': 51}

The bowl triumph capped a 7-6 season that was the Jackets' first winning campaign since 2018 and nearly equaled the number of wins the team had between 2019 and 2021 (nine).\n\nKey took over as interim coach after the fourth game of 2022 and led the Jackets to a 4-4 record and one win from bowl eligibility.\n\nThe 2024 season kicks off overseas with an ACC matchup against Florida State in Dublin, Ireland, on Aug. 24. One week later, the Jackets host Georgia State in the first of four nonconference contests that include VMI, Notre Dame (in Atlanta) and Georgia.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Hokies finally got complementary play in Brent Pry's first season. Keli Lawson's pick-six and Tucker Holloway's 90-yard punt return touchdown allowed the hosts to build an 11-point lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThat's when it went downhill. Quickly. Georgia Tech had scoring drives of 90 and 73 yards in the fourth quarter to take the lead. The first score came after a Virginia Tech fumble, and the second came on a drive in which the Yellow Jackets converted on third-and-19. A second fourth-quarter turnover sealed the Hokies' fate in their sixth consecutive loss.\n\nPosition(s) of strength: Georgia Tech's offense took a massive step forward in 2023 during Key's first full season. The Jackets led the Bowl Subdivision by improving their scoring average by 13.9 points from 2022 (31.1 points per game in 2023 compared to 17.2 in 2022) and averaging 99.4 yards per game more than they did in 2022 (424.6 compared to 325.2).\n\nAlmost every player responsible for the offensive turnaround is back for another season.\n\nThe group is led by quarterback Haynes King. The redshirt junior put up gaudy numbers with 2,842 passing yards, 737 rushing yards, 27 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns. He was the fourth ACC quarterback since 2000 to put up those types of numbers, joining Deshaun Watson, Jerod Evans and Lamar Jackson. His 37 touchdowns responsible for set a program record previously held by Joe Hamilton.\n\nKing didn't have to do it all. He will have plenty of weapons at his disposal with leading rusher Jamal Haynes (1,059 yards and seven touchdowns) and No. 4 runner Trey Cooley (274 yards and three scores).\n\nThe Jackets' top three receivers from one year ago are back. Eric Singleton Jr., Malik Rutherford and Christian Leary combined for 1,525 yards and 12 touchdowns on 119 catches.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nKing returns four starters on the offensive line in left tackle Ethan Mackenny, left guard Joe Fusile, center Weston Franklin and right tackle Jordan Williams.\n\nMiddle Tennessee transfer Keylan Rutledge is expected to start at right guard.\n\nMississippi State transfer Ryland Goede is projected to fill in Dylan Leonard's role at tight end.\n\nWhat's new in Atlanta: The inability for Georgia Tech's defense to get off the field in key situations last season led to Key making wholesale changes on that side of the ball.\n\nKey replaced the entire defensive staff. He brought in former Duke and Texas A&M defensive coordinator Tyler Santucci to lead the unit, and Santucci rounded out his staff with Jess Simpson (defensive line), Cory Peoples (defensive backs) and Kyle Pope (outside linebackers).\n\nThe coaching changes trickled down to a mass exodus of players entering the transfer portal. Twenty of the 32 Georgia Tech players who entered the transfer portal were defensive players, and that included two players who arrived through the portal for spring practice and left in the second transfer window (Jack Barton and Ayo Tifase).\n\nWhile Georgia Tech didn't sign that many players out of the transfer portal (12), it did sign 23 high school players to help fill out the roster.\n\nKey made one change on offense with Trent McKnight joining as wide receivers coach.\n\nLingering questions: Santucci turned Duke's defense into one of the ACC's best units in 2023. Now he'll be tasked with duplicating the task at Georgia Tech with a defense that returns five starters and two others who cracked the starting lineup from a year ago.\n\nSantucci isn't simply replacing a starter here and there. He's also needing to establish depth across the board after 11 contributors entered the transfer portal after the season.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets had two starters graduate (linebacker Paul Moala and cornerback Myles Sims) and lost 11 other contributors to the transfer portal. Those who left include starting defensive tackle D'Quan Douse, rush end Kyle Kennard and nickel K.J. Wallace. The other eight appeared on the depth chart throughout the season, including key backups on the defensive line, linebacker and cornerback.\n\nGeorgia Tech brought in 12 players from the transfer portal. Nine of those are defensive players expected to help fill the voids that were created with the departures.\n\nSantucci's defense at Duke led the ACC in scoring (19 points per game allowed) and ranked top 50 in the nation in seven major categories.\n\nHe can rely on linemen Makius Scott and Zeek Biggers, linebacker Trenilyas Tatum and defensive backs LaMiles Brooks and Ahmari Harvey from last season's squad.\n\nThe Jackets brought in six defensive players from Power Four programs. EJ Lightsey (Georgia) and Jackson Hamilton (Tennessee) are expected to solidify the linebacker position. The defensive line gained depth with end Romello Height (Southern Cal) and interior lineman Jordan van den Berg (Penn State). The secondary depth was solidified with cornerback Warren Burrell (Tennessee) and safety Zachary Tobe (Illinois).\n\nDamien Sordelett (540) 981-3124\n\ndamien.sordelett@roanoke.com\n\nVTFB gamebug\n\nVIRGINIA TECH AT VANDERBILT\n\nSeason opener\n\nAug. 31: Noon TV: ESPN", 'source': {'uri': 'richmond.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Richmond Times-Dispatch'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@richmond.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'daily_progress@richmond.com', 'name': 'Daily Progress', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/0b/40b82567-13bd-5bab-a266-4e6de15a0acc/6687499377b72.preview.jpg?crop=1756%2C922%2C4%2C113&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.4901960784313726, 'wgt': 458731579, 'relevance': 51}

Namma Yatri plans to expand the test to Delhi- NCR in about a fortnight, sources said.\n\nWith this move, Namma Yatri will probably become the first ride-hailing service to pilot auto rentals in the country. Ola and Uber have been offering cab rentals in the country for a few years.\n\nThe service, built on the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) network, offers passengers packages starting at Rs 190 for a 10-kilometer, one-hour auto rental. For the same distance and duration, the rates are Rs 250 for non-AC mini cabs, Rs 285 for AC mini cabs, Rs 320 for sedans, and Rs 390 for XL cabs, Moneycontrol has learnt.\n\nFor distances above 10 kilometers and an hour, Namma Yatri will charge an additional distance fare ranging from Rs 10-21 per kilometer depending on the vehicle type along with a flat usage fare of Rs 3 per minute. The service will also levy pickup charges ranging from Rs 20-30 based on the vehicle type.\n\nFor night rides, Namma Yatri will charge a flat fee of Rs 250 if the ride starts or ends anytime between 10pm and 5am. Toll charges and other surcharges will be separate. Moneycontrol has reached out to Namma Yatri for comments on this pilot and will update once a response is received.\n\nNamma Yatri was launched by SoftBank-backed fintech firm JusPay in collaboration with Nandan Nilekani's BECKN Foundation and with the support of Bengaluru's Auto Rickshaw Driver's Union (ARDU) in November 2022. A key attraction is zero commission levied from drivers as compared to Ola and Uber which take a 30-40 percent commission.\n\nInitially an auto-only service, the company launched cab services in Bengaluru in April this year.\n\nNamma Yatri makes money by collecting a subscription fee from drivers to sustain its no-commission. Drivers have two options under the plan: Rs 25 for unlimited trips per day or Rs 3.50 per ride (no charges after 10 trips).\n\nThe service was spun out of JusPay earlier this year into a separate firm called Moving Tech Innovations Limited. Shan M S and Magizhan Selvan, who were part of JusPay, are currently leading the spun-off mobility business.\n\nMoneycontrol reported in April that the firm is in final talks to raise $10-$15 million in its maiden funding round. The firm is in talks with investors such as Blume Ventures, Singapore-based Antler and Google, sources told Moneycontrol at the time.

While this form of exercise may not feel as impactful as a high-intensity workout or distance run, walking actually does wonders for the body.\n\n"Physically it will improve cardiovascular health by strengthening the heart, thereby helping circulation, lower blood pressure, helping in the prevention of heart disease and stroke," Matthew Nolan, a chief instructor at Barry\'s in New York City, told HuffPost.\n\n"Mental health is also a great benefit to walking. The release of the endorphins while walking will help boost mood and overall mental state," he added.\n\nWhat\'s more, daily walking can help build bone and muscle strength and improve joint health, said Nolan. In fact, people with chronic lower back pain and knee pain can benefit from a regular walking regimen, said Tyler Moldoff, a physical therapist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.\n\n"It\'s really been exciting more recently seeing a lot of new research coming out about how something as simple as walking can really be an exceptional exercise, when done properly," he said.\n\nTo Moldoff, "done properly" means getting 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week. This equates to at least 30 minutes of walking, five days a week -- and you should aim for 5,000 to 10,000 steps (or more) daily.\n\nOnce you hit these requirements, there are additional ways to get even more out of your exercise regimen. Below, experts share what you can do to challenge yourself while building up strength and endurance during your walks:\n\n1. Keep up a quick walking speed.\n\nU.S. government guidelines note that adults need at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, which can include brisk walking -- but not walking at a snail\'s pace.\n\nMoldoff said the intensity of aerobic activity is typically measured in relation to your heart rate.\n\nWhile it can be hard to know your exact heart rate during a walk, a good way to ensure you\'re pushing yourself is to listen to a fast-paced song -- starting at, say, 100 beats per minute -- and then move to the music\'s beat, Moldoff added.\n\n"You can simply do a Google search or even on Spotify or Apple Music, look for different genres of songs that may be enjoyable for individuals at 100 beats per minute, and then trying to sync your cadence to the beat of the song," he said.\n\n"And if you\'re following along [to a] song that is ... 100 beats per minute, you can be sure that after a few minutes you\'ll start to work up a little bit of a breath and you\'ll be hitting that moderate intensity."\n\nIf that tempo feels too slow for you, look up songs that are 110 or 120 beats per minute instead.\n\nAnd as a bonus, music makes walking more enjoyable, Moldoff said.\n\n2. Try interval jogging or speed walking.\n\nIf you\'re not quite ready to maintain a fast walking pace for all 30-plus minutes of your walk, consider incorporating a faster pace at select times during your workout.\n\nNolan said that in Barry\'s classes, instructors frequently do interval-based training, which you can try in your walk, too.\n\n"You can do [this] at home by incorporating short bursts of fast walking or even jogging to increase intensity," Nolan stated.\n\nFor example, you might start small with a 30-second jog or minute-long speed walk and increase the duration when your body feels ready.\n\n3. Add strength training to your walk.\n\n"You could also walk with light weights or do some simple body weight exercises like squats, lunges or pushups during points of the walk to work different muscle groups," Nolan said.\n\nTo start, simply plan your walk ahead of time and pick some designated places, such as your driveway or a local park, to do some body weight training. Writing out your workout in advance can also help you hold yourself accountable.\n\nYou might do five pushups, 15 crunches and a one-minute plank repeated three times, or whatever combination makes sense for you. Just be sure to switch up your strength workout to target different muscles in your exercise regimen.\n\nYou could also try walking with a weighted vest or a backpack filled with books for an added challenge, Moldoff said.\n\n"Simply by doing that, you can help increase your metabolic rate, which improves your oxygen consumption, and that relates to a greater calorie burn," he stated, adding that this can "strengthen the muscle groups of the leg."\n\n4. Or walk along a hilly path.\n\nWalking on a path with hills is another way to boost your daily walk, Moldoff said.\n\nWalking downhill has been shown to improve muscle strength in the lower extremities and reduce the stress that\'s put on the cardiovascular system, he stated.\n\n"So, interestingly enough, it will likely be less stressful on our breathing and our heart rate," Moldoff noted. "It will make it more comfortable, but at the same time, you\'re actually improving your muscle strength more effectively relative to simply level walking."\n\nMeanwhile, walking uphill can provide more of a challenge to your cardiovascular system, and some research suggests that it can benefit people with knee joint issues.\n\nNo matter what you do to up your walking regimen, it\'s important to stay consistent, said Nolan.\n\n"The benefits of walking are best realized with regular, consistent practice," he said. "Aim for at least 30 minutes most days of the week."\n\nBut it\'s important to take days off when you need them and listen to your body for any signs of pain or discomfort, Nolan added.\n\nIt may take time to build up enough strength and endurance to incorporate these walking challenges, and that\'s OK. As you commit to a regular walking regimen, the benefits will begin to emerge.\n\n"Walking is a simple, accessible form of exercise that can truly open the door to a healthier lifestyle," Nolan stated. "By incorporating these tips, you can maximize the benefits and enjoy daily walks even more."\n\nWant to get in some more steps?

Prices and availability are subject to change.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Lamincoa women\'s walking shoes HuffPost readers can\'t stop buying\n\nIf you weren\'t already convinced to buy these by HuffPost Shopping writer Kristen Adaway\'s testimonial that they\'re the best walking shoes she\'s ever worn, perhaps the 4,000+ 5-star ratings on Amazon will do the trick. Reviewers especially love how comfy and flexible they are, and that they\'re well-suited for people with wider feet. You can snag these in 16 different colors, in women\'s sizes 5.5-10.\n\nPromising review: "Exactly what I was hoping for! These fit so nicely, very true to size and comfortable. They have lots of flexibility to them while still hugging the foot in the right places. Decent cushion for the foot... like walking on a cloud. I normally wear a size 8, occasionally and 8.5 or even 9 depending on the brand and style of shoe. I ordered these in an 8 and the fit was perfect. My feet are a smidge on the wider side with my second toe being longer than the first. Will happily order another pair when these wear out :)" -- Emily\n\nA pair of lightweight Skechers walking shoes with breathable mesh\n\nSkechers is a big-name brand among shoe shoppers, and it\'s not hard to see why, when they make durable, supportive, and good-looking shoes like these. Their high-rebound cushioning and "Comfort Pillar" technology will support your feet with every step, while the breathable mesh and insole keep the shoes lightweight. They\'re available in both regular and wide women\'s sizes 5-13 in eight color combos, or men\'s sizes 8-14.\n\nPromising review: "This is my second pair of Sketchers Go Walk and they are the most comfortable sneaker. They are soft, have good arch support and a solid gripping sole. I walk 2-3 miles a day and these out-perform any other walking shoe. Fit is true to size. I highly recommend to any who walk or stand on their feet for hours a day." -- Shirley Cody\n\nA convenient pair of slip-on shoes with over 25.000 5-star ratings\n\nWith over 25,000 5-star ratings, it\'s safe to say these shoes are a reviewer favorite. Their design makes them oh-so-easy to slip on and go, no laces necessary. Their arch support is also ideal for those of you who deal with foot pain such as bunions or plantar fasciitis. You can buy them in women\'s sizes 5.5-10.5, with a choice of 17 colors.\n\nPromising review: "I very rarely ever leave reviews...but this product needed a review. I am a nurse and am on my feet all day. My shoes were worn out and I was in need of a new pair. I searched for a new pair but hate that athletic shoes are so speedy especially since I go through a pair about once a year. Then I found these. They were only $33 so even if they didn\'t last for six months I wouldn\'t be out that much money. So I took a chance. They arrived on time and when I looked at them I honestly wasn\'t sure if I liked them. Then I lifted them up and it felt like I didn\'t have anything in my hand. They are so lightweight I couldn\'t believe it. I put them on and they felt awesome. I have a very wide foot and sometimes have trouble finding a ahoe that fits my foot. These are wide enough for me and I even could have probably gone down a size. They are so comfortable to wear and easy to slip on. My foot pain is gone since I started wearing these shoes two weeks ago. I get so many compliments from my patients wondering where I got these shoes from. They look great with scrubs as well as jeans. All in all, I tried to hate them, but I can\'t cuz they are just awesome!" -- KATHY FEIST\n\nA set of non-slip men\'s walking shoes with a supportive insole\n\nThough they still have laces for decoration, these bad boys slip right on without the hassle of tying your shoes. They\'re called a "fashion sneaker," but don\'t think style is the only thing they\'re good for -- the anti-skid grooves on the outsole will keep you from slipping as you walk, and they\'re suitable for a variety of life activities, from traveling to working out. They come in 12 colors in men\'s sizes 7.5-12.\n\nPromising review: "I bought these shoes for work, and honestly they\'ve just become my every day shoe. They\'re comfortable and feel great on my feet. They support really well and my feet don\'t slide around inside the shoe. The sole of the shoe are super comfortable and haven\'t torn easily like my other pairs. Easy to put on and great for a rushed morning. Highly recommend for a nice, well fitting shoe for a great price." -- George Bean\n\nI had to do a double take when I first saw these, because I thought there was no way comfortable walking shoes could fit so well with a business casual dress code -- and for such a low price tag. Reviewers can vouch for how these versatile men\'s shoes, designed with breathable mesh and a memory foam insole, can come in handy both inside the office and out of it. They come in 12 colors in men\'s sizes 8-14.\n\nPromising review: "I got these for my husband as a Christmas gift and he has already asked for a second pair. I originally got him the grey and they looked so sharp for work. He said they are very comfortable as well and he walks majority of the day at work and on his feet. We got him another pair in dark blue. You can definitely dress them up or wear with jeans. My husband was really impressed with them for how good the price was!" -- Spencer Hudak\n\nA cute pair of stretchy walking shoes with a moisture-wicking insole\n\nThese might be my favorite on the list just because of how cute they are; the 14 color options create so many possibilities for styling these with your wardrobe. Of course, they\'re practical, too: The insole wicks away moisture and reduces odor, while the midsole and outsole are equipped with Energycloud cushioning to keep your feet cool and comfortable. You can buy them in women\'s sizes 6-10.\n\nPromising review: "I have had these for SEVERAL months and absolutely love them. They are easy to slip off and on and are so so comfortable. They wash and dry nicely in the washer/ dryer and still fit just as comfortably as before. The have endured a lot of wear but have not torn or popped a hole after it all so I\'ve been very impressed. I wear them to workout, all day cleaning at our church (concrete slab floors), and chasing our kids all around. Will be ordering again when needed" -- Momma Tina\n\nThey may not look high-tech, but these shoes feature Reebok\'s "DMX" foam, cushioning technology that moves air back and forth beneath your feet as you walk. That support, along with these shoes\' price compared to other walking shoes, have reviewers falling in love with them. They come in five colors in women\'s sizes 5-12.\n\nPromising review: "I needed a new pair of, what I call, tennis shoes for a while. I haven\'t bought a pair of Reeboks in ages. But when I saw these I really liked the design. The reviews were good so I decided to give them a try. I have really high arches so I try to find shoes that can support my feet. I was worried that the size 8 I ordered might not be a true size 8. I\'ve ordered shoes before that were not true to size, but I can honestly say these shoes are true to size. With the cushion inserts the shoes have I don\'t have any issues with my feet hurting because of my high arches. I could literally walk in this shoes for hours without any discomfort. They are extremely lightweight. I\'m really glad I decided to buy these, and the best part is it didn\'t cost me an arm and leg to get them." -- Linda Wroblewski\n\nA set of sleek Bruno Marc men\'s walking shoes that can be dressed up or down\n\nOver 9,000 Amazon customers gave these shoes a 5-star stamp of approval, so you know they\'re good. Not only do they look sleek and fashionable, able to be worn with just about any outfit, but they slip on easily, weigh less than 8 ounces, and have the classic breathable knitted upper you expect from a walking shoe. They\'re available in 11 colors in men\'s sizes 6.5-14.\n\nPromising review: "I spend a lot of time shooting pool in some local venues. Spending all weekend playing a tournament and on my feet. It\'s gotten rough the older I get. I ordered these just hoping for something comfortable. But they seriously exceeded my expectations. They are designed to slide on and off. I see in other reviews where people reversed the shoe laces and tied them up. My opinion is you don\'t have to do it. They are light weight, comfortable and have a very soft insole.\n\nGreat job to the designers of this shoe." -- Chris Cooper\n\nA comfy and trendy set of women\'s slip-on sock sneakers\n\nYou might associate sock sneakers with high-end designers like Balenciaga, but you can get them for cheaper -- and considering how the knit uppers and elastic cuff can provide some much-needed comfort, you shouldn\'t waste that chance. This option from DOUSSPRT, which has an air cushion design for extra support, is an absolute steal under $30, and is available in 18 colors in women\'s sizes 5.5-11.\n\nPromising review: "These shoes are great! Didn\'t expect to use them for hiking - but they worked perfectly. Kept my feet safe and comfortable after wearing them all day, walking up and down very steep hills and inclines. Provided great support, along with the compression socks I wore with them. Love the glove-like way they enclose your feet - easy on and easy off yet secure once on. Extremely good buy. Performed well beyond expectation." -- AuggieO\n\nA casual pair of Skechers that\'s an Amazon bestseller\n\nOn the hunt for a walking shoe that doesn\'t look so... sneaker-ish? Look no further. These slip-on Skechers have a sleeker look, but retain the breathable mesh and high-rebound cushioning of some of their more athletic-looking shoes. It comes in a whopping 25 colors, in women\'s 5-13 with narrow and wide sizes available, too.\n\nPromising review: "I have wide feet and have suffered with corns and rubbing on my toes no matter the shoe. This has hampered my enjoyment of places that require much walking, even walking around my neighborhood for exercise. I tried this on as soon as I received them, and they were so comfortable! I walked around in them and never once were my feet uncomfortable. There\'s plenty of room in the toe box and the soles are kind of a spongy, springy material that make walking fun. And this shoe can be machine washed which is a plus!" -- Kris L. Cullinan\n\nA durable and breathable pair of lightweight mesh sneakers\n\nWith a sock-like fit and shock-absorbing rubber outsole, these shoes are a bargain at less than $27. They\'re also super lightweight, according to reviewers, making them perfect for days of walking at the airport or grocery shopping. You can pick between 14 colors and women\'s sizes 5.5-10.\n\nPromising review: "I love these shoes and it\'s true to size when ordering. I wear these out when I\'m grocery shopping, working out, or even when I\'m wanting an athleisure day! Definitely ordering a 2nd pair. Super comfortable to run, walk, dance, and doing heavy lifting." -- Xtyxo', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.style.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jillian_wilson@ca.style.yahoo.com', 'name': 'Jillian Wilson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/huffpost_life_308/ef943810d7f297b9982beab5f2684465', 'eventUri': 'eng-9732040', 'sentiment': 0.4352941176470588, 'wgt': 458723815, 'relevance': 65}

Despite the success, Curry has never represented Team USA at the Olympics before. He spoke to Fadeaway World about how his first-ever Team USA training camp is going.\n\n"It\'s still early. We\'re just over a week in and continue the vibes of figuring out the strengths of this team, and how we need to play. It\'s been an amazing experience so far. The energy of this group, a lot of guys who have accomplished a lot of things in their basketball careers, and it just seems like we\'re having fun playing the game."\n\nCurry said he was enjoying the competitive but supportive environment before comparing himself to a kid in a candy store with the Olympics.\n\n"That\'s the cool part about having fun. You put agendas aside, you put the ego aside, well you don\'t put the ego aside but you bring the healthy ego of who you are, but you put aside everything other than winning. We talk about it every day. Hopefully, we can show it when we start. Everything around the Olympics, I\'m like a kid in a candy store because I\'ve never experienced it before."\n\nCurry came into the NBA in 2009 but has surprisingly never found himself representing the USA at the Olympics. He was not prominent enough to make the squad in 2012, but teammates LeBron James and Kevin Durant both participated back then, with 2012 being Durant\'s first Olympic appearance and James\' third.\n\nIn 2016, Curry chose not to play for Team USA after a long NBA season which saw him become the first-ever unanimous league MVP but the Warriors also became the first team to blow a 3-1 NBA Finals lead. Curry picked up minor injuries he chose to heal in the summer of 2016 instead of traveling to Rio de Janeiro for the games.\n\nThe two-time league MVP could\'ve played in Tokyo 2020, held in 2021, but he chose to rest as the USA took a younger squad with players like Jayson Tatum getting their first Olympic call-up.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics might legitimately be the last chance for Curry to be a viable contender for selection, so it\'s wonderful to see him participate alongside LeBron and Durant. We know Curry and Durant were teammates for three seasons, while LeBron and Curry have been occasional All-Star teammates, but all three representing the USA at the Olympics together is huge.\n\nCurry had a longer offseason than he\'s used to, with the Warriors missing the Playoffs, though Curry had declared his intention to play during the season. Even if Golden State made a Playoff run, Steph wouldn\'t have let this opportunity pass him by. He averaged 26.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 5.1 assists last season.\n\nRelated: Stephen Curry And Steve Kerr React To Donald Trump\'s Assassination Attempt\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

I worked really hard," boasted 6-year-old Bode.\n\nHis big brother, Izaac, says they\'ve both been preparing for this moment, participating in swim team, running for their track team and biking with their parents.\n\nAnd even with some of the highest temperatures Iowa\'s experienced all summer, Izaac said he maintained the mindset of a winner and just kept thinking, "I\'m strong, I\'m doing amazing, I feel great."', 'source': {'uri': 'kcci.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'KCCI'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'alyssa_gomez@kcci.com', 'name': 'Alyssa Gomez', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/a3ffef39-8539-48f9-b03c-88097f8e36f2/4c17a92b-6d7c-4147-80ef-944cf5426728.jpg?crop=0.788xw:0.788xh;0.113xw,0&resize=640:*', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 458694279, 'relevance': 33}

Other artists like Anuel AA quickly followed, buying Arecibo\'s Capitanes team before a new owner took over in 2023, and Ozuna acquiring Manatí\'s team, renaming it Los Osos, in 2022.

"The boom with urban artists revived the Puerto Rican sports history that had been forgotten."\n\nSabath said the momentum created by artists has fueled fans\' excitement beyond just seeing reggaeton stars. "Indirectly, these artists are attracting enough attention to make people interested in our league," he said. "It\'s a domino effect."\n\nA bittersweet moment took place recently, when Puerto Rico national men\'s basketball team, composed of several of the league\'s star players, qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. The victory over Lithuania broke a 20-year drought for the team that last competed in 2004, beating the USA team in the Athens Olympics. It is also a loss for the league\'s teams playing later in the summer.\n\nThe league\'s renaissance comes after its peak over 40 years ago. Teams in Bayamón, Quebradillas, Ponce and other towns had produced renowned players, including Butch Lee, the first Puerto Rican player to enter the National Basketball Association; Raymond Dalmau, whose son currently presides over the league; and Rubén Rodríguez, who played for Los Vaqueros in Bayamón.\n\nAs part of the current frenzy, ex-NBA players have moved to Puerto Rico in recent years to join the league. Will Barton and Jared Sullinger play for San Juan\'s team, while other ex-NBA players like DeMarcus Cousins, Lance Stephenson and Brandon Knight also joined before moving on to other stints.\n\nStill, some problems remain beyond the league\'s control, including severe budget cuts, with the government slashing the island\'s sports and recreation department budget by more than half over the past decade. A lack of investment and maintenance in sports arenas across the island has caused leaks, leading to game suspensions after heavy rains.\n\n"Despite the lack of economic resources, we\'ve been able to sort it out," said Ray Quiñones, secretary of sports and recreation of Puerto Rico, whose infrastructure budget was cut from about $15,300 in 2014 to barely $7,500 in 2024.\n\nSports arenas face the additional problem of chronic power outages across Puerto Rico, which is still rebuilding its electric grid after Hurricane María, a Category 4 storm that razed the island in September 2017.\n\nIn June, a game in Carolina between the home team, Los Gigantes, and Los Indios of Mayagüez was suspended after a widespread power outage left more than 340,000 customers without electricity. A month earlier, a game in San Juan\'s main arena was also suspended due to a power outage.\n\nDespite the challenges, younger generations are finding refuge outside their homes -- which also contend with frequent power outages -- and a new sense of pride by attending the games.\n\nFor fans like Annais Ramírez, basketball arenas feel like safe spaces, especially for women looking to engage in historically male-dominated areas.\n\n"There are so many artists coming to the games, and you wonder if you\'ll run into one," the 27-year-old said as she stood next to her friend, who sported a necklace with a diamond-encrusted "C" for the town of Carolina.\n\nHer love for Carolina\'s team has grown beyond her expectation to run into a celebrity. During her free time, Ramírez goes on social media to catch up on the games she couldn\'t attend in person, checking out highlights, halftime performances and crowd reactions.\n\n"Those motivate you to be part of the movement," she said.

Across all categories, the global subscription e-commerce market size is expected to reach around $900 billion by 2026. Subscriptions allow customers access to convenience, discounts, rare products, and other social perks. Whiskey subscriptions, in particular, offer whiskey enthusiasts the opportunity to try limited-release bottles, try whiskey from lesser-known distilleries, expand their palate, and build upon their home liquor collection.\n\nFor those who are new to whiskey, it is imperative to know that there is a difference between "whiskey" and "whisky," and it\'s not just the dropped "e" in its spelling. Whiskey includes bourbon, rye, and Irish whiskey, while whisky includes Scotch, Canadian, and Japanese whisky. However, regardless of the spelling, they are both of the same category of distilled spirits, which means that some of the subscriptions will ship you both whiskey and whisky, and some will simply focus on a single origin.\n\nThe below subscriptions range from monthly subscriptions of mini bottles that are perfect to gift to the whiskey beginner in your life, to a curated monthly service put together by a Napa Valley expert sommelier ideal for the whiskey expert that claims they\'ve already tried everything. However you like to imbibe or gift, there is a whiskey subscription that will fit into your current lifestyle or aspirations.\n\nFounded in 2012, Taster\'s Club claims to be the longest running and largest spirit of the month club. Taster\'s Club is the optimum choice for whiskey lovers who want a simple and straightforward subscription box experience. This subscription is a monthly offering that features just one full-size bottle of whiskey sourced from within the U.S., expertly curated by an in-house team. Subscribers can enjoy a variety of whiskey like rye and bourbon, including past features such as Garrison Bros.\' small batch Texas bourbon and Oregon Spirit Distillers\' 5-year malt whiskey.\n\nEvery month, subscribers will also get digital notes where they get to learn about the distillery, the production of the bottle, and drinking suggestions directly from the producer. In the package, Taster\'s Club also includes expert tasting notes, cocktail recipes, and an explanation of why it made that bottle its choice for the month. If you love the bottle of the month, members can also purchase the bottles again at the online shop, as well as explore other curated picks from past boxes and staff favorites.\n\nThe cost of the whiskey membership starts at $69.99 per month plus shipping. It offers a three-month, six-month, and yearly membership option for additional savings. Taster\'s Club currently ships to all U.S. states except Alaska, Hawaii, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Utah.\n\nFlaviar\n\nFlaviar is a whiskey subscription service that is great for liquor enthusiasts who want both the full-size bottle and a sampling experience. Its quarterly subscription box features one full-size bottle and one tasting box of three 50-milliliter vials with tasting notes. If you sign up for its prepaid yearly membership, it reduces your cost to $80 per delivery, which is a great deal for the bottles, vials, and curated experience. The more accessible option is the quarterly "pay-as-you-go" option that is $100 per delivery, which can be paused or canceled at any time.\n\nEvery subscriber is gifted a complimentary Flaviar Black membership, priced at $40 per year, which gives them special access to limited-edition releases, priority access to new releases, a roughly 10% discount on curated tasting boxes of a variety of spirits, and free shipping on qualifying orders. Flaviar is one of the few subscriptions that ships to all 50 states. The only exceptions are that it won\'t deliver to P.O. boxes and military addresses both in the U.S. or stationed abroad.\n\nFlaviar\'s online store features other spirits, including cognac, rum, and tequila, and even a special advent calendar every holiday season. This makes an exceptional gift for the whiskey lover who enjoys trying out new recipes, like when you want to serve a boozy apple cider for Thanksgiving. The advent calendar is a fan favorite and can be reserved as early as July.\n\nPour More\n\nPour More is the ideal choice for the whiskey enthusiast that wants to explore based on their interest and skill level. The Pour More whiskey of the month club currently offers subscriptions for six different liquors, including Scotch whisky and whiskies from around the world. Both Scotch and whiskey subscriptions are separated into three tiers: Intro, Explorer, and Enthusiast. Previous features have included The Macallan Classic Cut 2023 whiskey, The Glenlivet Enigma whiskey, and the Classic Cask 23-year Oloroso sherry-finished whiskey -- all highly rated and collector-worthy bottles.\n\nThe intro level starts at $50 per month and ships you bottles that are more enjoyable for a beginner\'s whiskey palate. The explorer level starts at $80 per month and is great for those who want to be more adventurous with their choices without necessarily splurging on top-shelf bottles. Lastly, the explorer level starts at $130 per month and is perfect for those who want to be wooed by distilleries, to enjoy the best of a curated selection, and to add to a home whiskey collection.\n\nEvery shipment includes one full-size bottle of whiskey sourced from around the world, tasting notes about how to enjoy each bottle, and a cocktail recipe so you can get creative at home. Subscribers can choose between a monthly or bi-monthly option, or gift themselves a yearly subscription. It currently ships to all U.S. states excluding Utah, Rhode Island, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n\nCraft Whisky Club\n\nCraft Whisky Club is the option for those who prefer Scotch whisky or who love to pair their whisky with a flight of snacks. This subscription ships to you every two months and allows you the choice to ship one or two bottles at a time. Every bottle comes with paired snacks that are intended to go right along with the flavors of the whiskey. Count us in for a snack pairing.\n\nUnlike other subscription boxes, it is common for the Craft Whisky Club to feature private barrel releases that were barreled specifically for this subscription, adding to the overall exclusivity. Subscribers will also get to enjoy tasting notes with every shipment where they can learn about the bottle they are drinking and its home distillery. They will also have access to exclusive first releases.\n\nSubscriptions with one bottle per shipment start at $55 per month, while a two-bottle subscription starts at $95 per month. Tax and shipping are included in the cost, which is a big plus compared to other subscriptions; the only downside is that they don\'t ship to the U.S. commonwealths and leave out seven U.S. states: Massachusetts, Alaska, Hawaii, Utah, Puerto Rico, Michigan, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Illinois.\n\nShots Box\n\nShots Box is the ideal option for the whiskey enthusiast who likes the idea of Flaviar but would prefer more frequent shipments and more agency in what they receive as their full-size bottle. Every two months, Shots Box sends you five mini bottles for you to enjoy. After receiving the mini bottles, you get to choose which one you would like to receive in a full-size bottle.\n\nThe only drawback is that Shots Box only offers pre-paid six-month and annual memberships, the latter of which start at a steeper price of $559.99. Half-a-year goes for $359.99. For consumers needing a more affordable option, this pricing plan may make it unattainable, even with the value of the perks. Shots Box ships to most U.S. states and its first shipment of your subscription also includes complimentary Official Glencairn glasses and a Shots Box tasting journal.\n\nWhat\'s unique about this subscription is that it includes access to virtual tastings, private Facebook groups, and in-person meetup groups in southern California. In the whiskey world, community is a hot commodity. There are also many virtual perks including free shipping once a month, early access to newly-launched spirits, and members-only coupons.\n\nThe Scotch Malt Whisky Society\n\nThe Scotch Malt Whisky Society may not be a typical subscription that curates monthly or quarterly boxes for its audience, but it does gives access to extremely limited releases through a membership program. The society has been curating whiskey since the 1970s and its current $99 annual membership fee allows you access to single-cask Scotch that has been handpicked by the Society\'s panel.\n\nThese bottles can be as affordable as $115 or as extravagant as $3,000, making it accessible for both the lower-budget consumer and the whiskey collector. Of this whole list of subscriptions, this is likely going to give you the most access to bottles rarely available in stores and from sought-after small distilleries.\n\nUpon signing up for a membership, you can choose to have a full-size bottle or an elaborate tasting kit sent to you for a reduced cost. This tasting kit includes three 100-milliliter single cask whisky bottles alongside snifter glasses, a water pitcher, notebook, and water dropper all branded by the Scotch Malt Whisky Society. Other perks of this membership include education from members-only online magazine called "Unfiltered" and access to private member venues all over the U.K. Scotch Malt Whisky Society ships to most U.S. states with only a few exceptions.\n\nWestward Whiskey\n\nWhile some customers prefer subscriptions that allow them to sample from multiple distilleries per quarter, this subscription is for those who prefer to subscribe to a single distillery they trust whose quality won\'t falter. Westward Whiskey is the winner of multiple gold medals at the San Francisco\'s World Spirits Competition and has its own subscription and membership in-house. It ships you one bottle of whiskey per quarter, plus offers lots of additional perks. Those perks include access to specialty quarterly releases, rare releases, and its distillery\'s whiskey library in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThis subscription is ideal for someone who wants to learn about production methods and try multiple bottles within the whiskey library of one distillery. With a team of Michelin-trained chefs, winemakers, and brewers, the team at Westward Whiskey is trained in a variety of food production jobs that it\'s bound to create whiskey you\'ll be excited to enjoy every quarter.\n\nSubscribers can choose between two tiers: the Expedition Club and the Founder\'s Club. There is no set price per quarter -- depends on the featured bottle that\'s chosen -- but it estimates the Expedition tier is roughly $100 per quarter, while the Founder\'s is roughly $300 per quarter. Both tiers include a complimentary Westward Experience per year, access to special release parties, early access to Westward Whiskey events, complementary members-only events, and discounts on merchandise. The Founder\'s tier\'s only difference is that subscribers can welcome three guests to some experiences and there is an exclusive Founder\'s Club tier event.\n\nSpirited Gifts\n\nSpirited Gifts is an online marketplace, gift service, and subscription service that offers three-month subscriptions for liquor lovers starting at $249. What\'s wonderful about this option is that you can choose between memberships specially for Scotch single malt, whiskey from the U.S., whisky from all around the world, Irish whiskey, rye, and Scotch lovers, among other spirit options.\n\nThis subscription model of Spirited Gifts is ideal for those who like to subscribe for a few months and then pause to enjoy the bottles before acquiring more, those who like to focus on enjoying bottles from a specific destination, and those who may want a specific liquor, like a Scotch or rye-only subscription. For those who often get bored or who are indecisive with their liquor options, this is also a great option as you can switch between subscriptions every few months.\n\nUnlike a lot of liquor subscription services, this subscription is very beginner-friendly as it sends you both classic labels and newer releases to start building your palate. Because Spirited Gifts is mainly a gifting subscription service, it offers more accessories to add to your subscription, including glassware and whiskey stones, making it the most customizable gifting option on this list. The only downside is that it only ships to 29 states.\n\nBounty Hunter\n\nBounty Hunter\'s whisky runner club is a monthly or quarterly whisky subscription that is curated just for you. What makes the Bounty Hunter subscription so special is that it is not a pre-curated box or selection from its online marketplace. Bounty Hunter\'s team is an expert team of wine and spirits sommeliers who have been in the field for decades and who have tasted thousands of wines and spirits every year. Through this practice, it also has built strong connections with distilleries around the world, which allows you access to high-end distilleries you might not have been able to visit.\n\nOnce you subscribe, a wine scout will reach out to you to discuss your first picks. There is no difference between the monthly and quarterly subscription except the frequency. Both clubs will include two bottles with one of them guaranteed to be a single malt or blended Scotch whisky and both subscriptions cost $299.99 per shipment.\n\nBounty Hunter\'s club focuses on Scotch whisky but it will include distillers from around the world. With the purchase of a membership, subscribers also get a 20% discount on many items in an online shop and a complimentary Trailblazer membership, which includes unlimited standard shipping. The only drawback is that Bounty Hunter only has limited access to shipping spirits and will currently only ship to Alaska, California, D.C., Florida, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and North Dakota.\n\nIrishmalts\n\nIrishmalts is also not a traditional subscription box or service, but instead an international delivery service. This is a great option for someone who would like to educate themselves on Irish whiskey and distilleries or who wants to expand their Irish whiskey collection at home. If you would still like to participate in a subscription-like service, you can order its monthly tasting boxes that are priced at roughly $30, and join its virtual tastings. Previous tasting boxes have included samples from smaller distilleries such as Portmagee.\n\nFor fans of all Irish liquor, you will be pleased to find that it also offers a fine selection of Irish spirits, including vodka, rum, cream liqueur, gin, and poitín, a traditional Irish distilled spirit similar to moonshine. Many of these spirits are also available in minis so you can curate your own tasting experience to make recipes at home, like this Irish cream.\n\nIrishmalts ships to all 50 states but it is advised to ask if it ships to military addresses or P.O. boxes before you order. Because it is shipped from Ireland, prepare for a steep delivery fee starting at $52 for one bottle; it\'s advised to stock up with every order as the shipping costs only go up $14 per bottle.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis list was curated after researching dozens of subscriptions that both included whiskey and featured whiskey exclusively. I read hundreds of reviews across social media, Reddit, and Google and whittled it down to these 11 subscriptions and delivery services.\n\nAs a former subscription box curator, I am aware of what makes an enticing and entertaining unboxing experience and you can trust that these above services have the best reputation, have the most satisfied customers, and provide the most entertaining unboxing experience. No matter if your aspirations are laid-back or posh, there is a whiskey subscription that fits your needs and budget.', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.style.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lj7_tkslK0JFR0HChuZFwg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tasting_table_543/5c2c6a1676e7ef0c6e89da16aa4ba9eb', 'eventUri': 'eng-9740331', 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'wgt': 458692687, 'relevance': 5}

But in recent years, the 23-year-old has left the arena with a hoarse voice, often wearing a T-shirt that reads "Carola," a nickname for her town.\n\n"We started making this fun, and I wanted to represent the town where I\'m from," said Braña, who attended her first game the year Puerto Rican reggaeton star Bad Bunny bought a team in the island\'s professional men\'s basketball league. It was also around that time that she began placing bets on different teams across Puerto Rico with her girlfriends.\n\nBraña\'s fervor illustrates how Puerto Rico\'s professional men\'s basketball league is experiencing a revival, driven by reggaeton stars like Bad Bunny, Ozuna and Anuel AA, who are stepping into the financial game, buying local teams and helping to stack up a loyal fan base the island hasn\'t witnessed in over 40 years.\n\nWhat were once half-empty arenas in Puerto Rico are now packed, filled with families and young fans cheering for their favorite teams, from Los Capitanes de Arecibo in northern Puerto Rico to Los Leones de Ponce in the south.\n\nAttendance more than doubled from 2018 to 2023, skyrocketing from some 480,000 tickets sold to nearly 1 million, according to Puerto Rico\'s professional men\'s basketball league, whose digital presence has also soared in the past few years.\n\nA pivotal moment in the league\'s revival came in 2021, when three-time Grammy winner Bad Bunny became co-owner of Los Cangrejeros de Santurce, along with his manager, Noah Assad.\n\nBad Bunny\'s frequent game-day visits sparked a resurgence in Puerto Rico\'s basketball scene. Other artists like Anuel AA quickly followed, buying Arecibo\'s Capitanes team before a new owner took over in 2023, and Ozuna acquiring Manatí\'s team, renaming it Los Osos, in 2022. The league, known as BSN, currently has 12 teams playing, compared with nine just four years ago.\n\nBasketball games have transformed into premier rendezvous events, attracting celebrities like NBA legend LeBron James, former boxer Floyd Mayweather and reggaeton artists including Arcangel and Rauw Alejandro, capturing audiences of all ages hoping to get a glimpse of them.\n\n"When Noah and Bad Bunny came along, we generated a lot of noise," said Ricardo Dalmau, president of BSN. "It was an explosion of attention."\n\nDalmau said local TV ratings also saw an upward tick after they began broadcasting some games in 2021, with the biggest surprise being their largest viewership block: women ages 18 to 49, a new audience that was also reflected in the bleachers.\n\n"You never know what artist you\'re going to find in the (league)," he said.\n\nBefore its recent surge in popularity, the league was under financial strain. Although Dalmau did not provide specific numbers, he said there used to be a lot of uncertainty about whether certain teams would participate or whether the league could fulfill players\' contracts. "We don\'t have those problems anymore," he said.\n\nJavier Sabath, a popular basketball commentator on the island, said he is witnessing what his father -- a sports commentator himself decades ago -- describes as the environment in the 1980s, the heyday of the league.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"New generations have never seen this before," Sabath said. "The boom with urban artists revived the Puerto Rican sports history that had been forgotten."\n\nSabath said the momentum created by artists has fueled fans\' excitement beyond just seeing reggaeton stars. "Indirectly, these artists are attracting enough attention to make people interested in our league," he said. "It\'s a domino effect."\n\nA bittersweet moment took place recently, when Puerto Rico national men\'s basketball team, composed of several of the league\'s star players, qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. The victory over Lithuania broke a 20-year drought for the team that last competed in 2004, beating the USA team in the Athens Olympics. It is also a loss for the league\'s teams playing later in the summer.\n\nThe league\'s renaissance comes after its peak over 40 years ago. Teams in Bayamón, Quebradillas, Ponce and other towns had produced renowned players, including Butch Lee, the first Puerto Rican player to enter the National Basketball Association; Raymond Dalmau, whose son currently presides over the league; and Rubén Rodríguez, who played for Los Vaqueros in Bayamón.\n\nAs part of the current frenzy, ex-NBA players have moved to Puerto Rico in recent years to join the league. Will Barton and Jared Sullinger play for San Juan\'s team, while other ex-NBA players like DeMarcus Cousins, Lance Stephenson and Brandon Knight also joined before moving on to other stints.\n\nStill, some problems remain beyond the league\'s control, including severe budget cuts, with the government slashing the island\'s sports and recreation department budget by more than half over the past decade. A lack of investment and maintenance in sports arenas across the island has caused leaks, leading to game suspensions after heavy rains.\n\n"Despite the lack of economic resources, we\'ve been able to sort it out," said Ray Quiñones, secretary of sports and recreation of Puerto Rico, whose infrastructure budget was cut from about $15,300 in 2014 to barely $7,500 in 2024.\n\nSports arenas face the additional problem of chronic power outages across Puerto Rico, which is still rebuilding its electric grid after Hurricane María, a Category 4 storm that razed the island in September 2017.\n\nIn June, a game in Carolina between the home team, Los Gigantes, and Los Indios of Mayagüez was suspended after a widespread power outage left more than 340,000 customers without electricity. A month earlier, a game in San Juan\'s main arena was also suspended due to a power outage.\n\nDespite the challenges, younger generations are finding refuge outside their homes -- which also contend with frequent power outages -- and a new sense of pride by attending the games.\n\nFor fans like Annais Ramírez, basketball arenas feel like safe spaces, especially for women looking to engage in historically male-dominated areas.\n\n"There are so many artists coming to the games, and you wonder if you\'ll run into one," the 27-year-old said as she stood next to her friend, who sported a necklace with a diamond-encrusted "C" for the town of Carolina.\n\nHer love for Carolina\'s team has grown beyond her expectation to run into a celebrity. During her free time, Ramírez goes on social media to catch up on the games she couldn\'t attend in person, checking out highlights, halftime performances and crowd reactions.\n\n"Those motivate you to be part of the movement," she said.

Clubs like the NYCB Dragons compete all around the world, said member Demar Ayee, 30, of New York City, shown top left.\n\nJohn Russo\n\nMAYS LANDING -- Tema Morelli had never competed in team sports until she found the River Sisters, a dragon boat racing club comprised of women who have survived breast cancer.\n\n"It\'s been very important that I\'ve stayed with the River Sisters," said the 71-year-old Maple Shade, Burlington County, resident who has been cancer-free for 19 years.\n\nThe hardest part, though, isn\'t the paddling.\n\n"It\'s difficult that to be on this team you have to be a member of that experience. That part\'s hard," Morelli said.\n\nWomen and men, from cancer survivors like Morelli to their supporters, hit Lake Lenape on Sunday for the eighth annual Cancer Support Community Dragon Boast Festival. As drums blasted and strokes were called out, rowers in 40-foot boats raced 200 meters to support families impacted by cancer -- and maybe to win a couple of races along the way.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It began in 2016, and no races were held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe morning was filled with qualifying races in which each boat competed at least twice. There were three main categories of races -- community teams, corporate sponsors and clubs -- with a few subclasses in each. A flower ceremony to honor those who have died from cancer and a lunch session split the morning qualifiers and afternoon finals.\n\nEach boat has 20 paddlers and a drummer, so about 800 people participated on the water.\n\nCSC, which formed in 2002 after a merger of The Wellness Community (founded in 1982) and Gilda\'s Club (1991), is a national organization that provides support groups and other programing to people impacted by cancer, from patients to families and loved ones to caregivers. The New Jersey branch, the only one in the state, is based in Linwood.\n\n"Most of these people, with the exception of a few that are first-timers, a majority have come year after year after year," Melville said. "This is a wonderful event, we look forward to this every year, and we love inviting the public and telling everybody about our mission. It is our goal that nobody faces cancer alone."\n\nThe entry fees, from $1,100 to $2,400, with some groups donating more, go toward the foundation, Melville said. Last year, the event raised $110,000, and she hoped this year exceeds that.\n\nThere were T-shirt, hat sales and games to benefit CSCNJ. Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City held raffles, Somers Point Brewery donated a few kegs of beer, and Tito\'s Vodka was a top sponsor providing refreshments, Melville said. Vendors and food trucks were also on hand.\n\n"This is our largest fundraiser every year," Melville said.\n\n\'It\'s living\'\n\nMelville lost her mother to cancer nearly 20 years ago. She said it\'s difficult to find somebody who has not been closely impacted by cancer.\n\n"I was in high school when she was diagnosed and in college when she died," said Melville, 42, of Linwood. "And 20 years ago, people weren\'t talking about it the way they are today (and) finding support groups when they need mental health support. It\'s great that we offer it, and it\'s great that we talk about it."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMorelli called herself the poster child for getting a mammography and said she was lucky because her cancer was caught early.\n\n"I can\'t say the same for a lot of our teammates. We have some people on the team who have had their third round (fighting cancer)," Morelli said.\n\nTeri Reed, 53, of Pitman, Gloucester County, will have been cancer-free for one year on Sept. 5. She is also a member of the River Sisters, which is based in Pennsauken, Camden County.\n\nShe said the support on a dragon boating team is similar to the support fighters need in their cancer journey.\n\n"You\'re determined, you\'re working together, and the support...," said Reed as she got emotional. "I\'ve only been with them for a couple months, but there\'s so much heart, there\'s so much support with each other and encouragement that I feel very fortunate to be with such a great amazing group of ladies."\n\nMorelli and Reed stressed the importance of programs like the Rivers Sisters. When they\'re together, they don\'t often talk about their struggles or their survival. Instead, the conversations are about rowing techniques and upcoming races.\n\n"It\'s living. We\'re focused on living!" Reed said.\n\n\'A win-win\'\n\nSunday\'s festival was welcome to veterans of dragon boating as well as newcomers.\n\nDana Patson-Denner and her Galloway Township-based company EOS Medical Supply competed for the first time Sunday. Her team, the EOS Medical Warriors, was decked out in pink bandanas. Patson-Denner wore a pirate hat and drummed the boat to a second-place finish in their heat. She was still feeling the nerves when she reached the shore.\n\n"I have a group of survivors, I have a group of doctors, and I have a group of nurses and friends," said Patson-Denner, 56, of Brigantine. "We\'ve all come together for one cause, and that\'s to fight cancer."\n\nPatson-Denner has owned her company for 18 years. She called the experience the perfect opportunity for team bonding at her office.\n\n"This last race was absolutely phenomenal, and we were much better than our first race," she said. "We\'re looking forward to next year and being able to sponsor again."\n\nThe New York Community Bank Dragons, who raced Sunday under the name Puff Puff Dragon, travel around the word to compete in these events, said member Demar Ayee.\n\nAyee, 30, of New York City, joined the team on a whim five years ago because its first race was on his birthday and he felt it was a different way to celebrate.\n\n"It\'s great because this is something we love to do, and also it\'s great that we can be here to support an important cause as well," Ayee said. "It\'s a win-win, if you think about it. A lot of times we will go to these things and there is some kind of support the money is going toward. You\'re racing, but you\'re also supporting something really nice."\n\nGALLERY: 8th annual Cancer Support Community Dragon Boat Festival\n\nContact John Russo: 609-272-7184\n\njrusso@pressofac.com\n\nTwitter: @ACPress_Russo\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Bungie's decision to release all missions for each act at once may lead to player FOMO in some cases. Releasing all story missions at once in Episode 2 could either work well or backfire for Destiny 2.\n\nDestiny 2's The Final Shape managed to go above and beyond players' expectations in terms of narrative, gameplay, and overall design, and it led the charge to the game's renaissance after a not-so-great year after Lightfall. With all eyes on Echoes Act 2 and beyond, Destiny 2's new episodic model has to succeed in many big ways - namely, it has to live up to the expectations players have after The Final Shape, and this means good content and constant content flow. Both of these feats are not easily accomplished, and with Destiny 2's Echoes sparking multiple controversies already, Revenant and Heresy have a huge weight on their shoulders.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about Echoes is that Destiny 2 started time-gating content even more than the seasonal model ever did, with each act having three weeks' worth of missions to play, and then weapons and Season Pass levels unlocking with each act. Bungie is seemingly listening to all feedback from players, to the point that Destiny 2 is buffing Titans soon and Prismatic Hunter is being nerfed in terms of PvP efficiency, and now a new change is planned for Episode 2 - Revenant. In fact, Bungie intends to make all missions available on release for each act, giving players freedom in how they choose to tackle content.\n\nRelated\n\nDestiny 2's Echoes Act 2 is Shooting Itself in The Foot by Buffing The Strongest Build in The Game\n\nDestiny 2's upcoming Act 2 for Echoes is making changes that will buff the game's best build even further.\n\nThe Argument For Destiny 2 to Release Story Missions With Each Episode 2 Act\n\nClose\n\nDestiny 2 is Making Big Changes to Its Narrative Episodic Model\n\nThere is no clear right or wrong path with the release of episodic content just yet, as Bungie is experimenting with a few possible solutions to make the game as enjoyable as possible. The same holds true for making all missions available from the get-go as each act is unlocked, rather than having them released on a weekly basis. This was Destiny 2's narrative model when the game first came out, and like back then, there are pros and cons to this.\n\nThe main benefit of having all act-related story missions available immediately is that players have free rein on how they want to tackle them - be it completing them as soon as possible or taking them on slowly in order not to drain the content well too soon. On one hand, this is a good way to address Destiny 2's FOMO problem (the fear of missing out) because it's up to players to decide what they want to do with it and when they want to play each mission, but it can also foster FOMO in another way.\n\nWhy Destiny 2 Might Shoot Itself In The Foot By Releasing All Story Missions At Once\n\nClose\n\nDestiny 2's New Narrative Approach For Episode 2 Revenant Could Backfire\n\nFor example, Destiny 2's Exotic mission for Echoes is set to be one of the biggest Bungie has ever done, but it's rumored to come out in Act 3 - meaning players won't be able to play it until at least August 27, but more likely weeks later. Without the current structure for weekly story missions, such an Exotic quest would drop immediately alongside Act 3, but it may still require players to complete a couple of weeks' worth of missions before it's even available. As such, one can decide to play at their own leisure, but if an Exotic is meta or build-defining, it may be worth it to speed up the process and complete all missions on launch.\n\nThis is still FOMO, but a different kind of it. Furthermore, it has happened in the past that by having all seasonal content available on launch, the game would dry up for weeks or months, with little incentive to keep playing. This could be a problem if Destiny 2's Episodes 2 and 3 want to retain players beyond the story missions and have them return as frequently as possible. As it stands, Bungie's decision could very well do good and make for a great change to the current model - but it has equal chances of backfiring.\n\nDestiny 2\n\nBungie's Destiny 2 is an online FPS that blends single-player and multiplayer content.

The tournament\'s top three flights -- the championship flight, first flight and senior championship -- were all won by El Paso residents, and all three were repeat winners.\n\n"There are a lot of good golfers in El Paso," Branden said. "It goes underrated in the area."\n\nThe championship matchup lived up to the billing. Neither side led by more than one hole, and the match was tied for most of its duration.\n\nThe Bargers took advantage first with a birdie on hole 3, but soon after the Mounces responded. The Bargers bogeyed hole 6 then the Mounces birdied the seventh to take the lead. An immediate Barger response with a birdie on hole 8 soon led to a tie with nine holes to play, both teams out at 31, 5-under.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their selected drive went in the right rough, and neither could find the green on approach out of there. Poor chip shots led to a 25-foot par putt to save the hole, but Steve converted it from long range.\n\nMore concern emerged on the par-3 17th after TJ missed a heavy-breaking 5-footer for par, but, again, Steve came through once again to save the hole, keeping things tied heading into hole 18.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"Steve made a lot of putts," Michael said. "It felt like he wasn\'t missing."\n\nBoth teams had mid-range birdie looks for the win on 18, but the Mounces came up just short. After watching his dad come through to create an opportunity, TJ saw a moment. He fired the putt from just on the front of the green, and it tracked toward the hole with plenty of pace. Right as it approached, it lipped around the hole\'s rim and out -- no good.\n\n"It caught a lot of the hole, it was a really good putt," Branden said. "It looked right down the middle."\n\nIn the playoff, starting back at hole 1, both teams found the fairway, but the Mounces had the early advantage with Branden\'s drive being a 340-yard missile. Their wedge approach stuck to about seven feet while the Bargers were in 20-foot range.\n\nNeither Barger could convert, but the outcome wasn\'t set when Branden missed the birdie putt. However, Michael rolled it in on a perfect line, securing the title. The Mounces finished with a 62, 10-under par.\n\n"Most teams don\'t have two guys who can hit it out there quite a ways like us," Michael said.\n\n"We have a lot of shorter birdie putts because we\'re hitting wedges into the greens," Branden added.\n\nIn the senior championship, Todd Manning and Jim Mounce -- Michael and Branden\'s father -- cruised by going 5-up through nine holes and maintaining it, losing just one hole all match for a 5&4 win. In the first flight, Jason Unzicker and Kyle Tague took the lead on hole 3 and never relinquished it, securing a 2-up victory with a 67, 5-under par. Both teams won their respective divisions last year.\n\nBoth Michael and Branden plan on playing in the Bloomington-Normal Medal Play Tournament in early August. Michael is looking for a summer trifecta after winning the Bloomington-Normal Match Play Championship on June 17.\n\nFollow Will Foley on Twitter: @thewillfoley\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

"We didn\'t get it fired up earlier in the year, but we fired off pretty well tonight and that\'s a testament to this crew."\n\nThere were seven cautions in the race, but during the late cautions Ward stayed on his line and came out firing to stay in the lead.\n\nWith six weeks left in the season Ward doesn\'t feel like he\'s out of it as he chases Burt Myers who has been the leader all season.\n\n"You can\'t count points right now," Ward said. "There are still a handful of cars still in it and we found that out the last two years. All in all, it was a good night and it\'s about winning races."\n\nFor Fleming, it was also a good night because he started in the back of the field and maneuvered his way up to the front. He may or may not have won the Fans Challenge and an extra $9,000 for finishing in the top four.\n\nFleming, along with Lee Jeffreys, Mike Speeney and Tim Brown had the four fastest qualifying times. They then had an option to start in the back of the field for the chance to win the $9,000 by finishing in the top four.\n\nTrack announcer Randy Pulliam asked each one of them in pre-race activities if they wanted to start in the rear of the field. Brown said no and so did Fleming while Jeffreys and Speeney took on the challenge. Jeffreys and Speeney failed to make it back into the top four.\n\nFleming, however, said after the race that he was forced to take the challenge because of a mix up for the blind draw.\n\n"(NASCAR officials) made me take the challenge," Fleming said. "They did it for me. I went in there to draw and they skipped me and we argued trying to get them to redraw and they would not redraw so they made me start in the rear."\n\nBefore Pulliam interviewed Ward in Victory Lane he announced that Fleming had taken the challenge and was $9,000 richer. However, race officials in the press box late Saturday night would not confirm that Fleming did win the fan\'s challenge.\n\n"I\'ve worked on this car all week and other than church on Wednesday night I was in the shop working every night and I didn\'t even go to my wife\'s birthday party but she\'s a part of this team," Fleming said. "That\'s how my wife is and she said get the car ready and don\'t worry about it."\n\nIf he did indeed win the $9,000 maybe Fleming, who turned 61 earlier in the week, can get his wife a late gift with that money.\n\n"Hopefully I\'ll get some of that money," he said with a smile. "I had a good car all night, but (Ward) won the race but I got the $9,000."\n\nOn lap 10 points\' leader Myers and Drew Moffit came together in a wreck and Myers ended up at the back of the field when the caution was over. About 25 laps later, however, Myers had worked his way up to 11th.\n\nMyers did wind up finishing sixth and said it could have been a lot worse.\n\n"We could have lost 80 points or so if I would have had to gone out after that wreck," Myers said. "So we just battled to make it what it was tonight. I know I told you earlier this season when we had three wins and everything was clicking, but Bowman Gray is like that. You just never know from week to week."\n\nAlso having a good night was Modified rookie Riley Neal, who finished just behind Myers for seventh place. Neal, who is in a battle with Slate Myers for rookie of the year in that division, started on the front row and hung around the lead pack the entire way. It was Neal\'s best showing in a 100 lap race this season.\n\nSlate Myers wound up finishing 13th after starting in the second row.\n\nZack Ore helps his points cause\n\nThe mild-mannered Zack Ore is working out just fine this season in the Sportsman Division.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOre said before the year started, he was going to be less of a hot head and more of a driver. He led from start to finish in the first 20-lap Sportsman race for the 20th time in his career.\n\nOre and Chase Robertson, the defending champion, are in a battle for the title. Robertson wound up 10th in the first race.\n\n"That\'s exactly what we needed to do, and we knew we had to have a good night because Chase and I are in a battle," Ore said referring to double-points night.\n\nZack Clifton was second, Connor Branch was third with Kirk Sheets fourth and Michael Adams was fifth.\n\n"I told myself I needed to be a little more aggressive here in the second half of the season," Ore said. "But this worked out."\n\nIn the second Sportsman race, Wesley Thompson got his first win of the season holding off Zack Clifton with Sterling Plemmons third.\n\n"This was my first win in two years," Thompson said. "(The fans) haven\'t seen me here (in Victory Lane) in a long time. I just have an awesome group behind me who keep working hard."\n\nRobertson did finish in sixth to salvage the night and Ore wound up 14th in the second race.\n\nJacob Creed rolls to win\n\nIn the 15-lap Street Stock race it was Jacob Creed winning for the first time as he raced Hayden Hall\'s car to change things up for Hall\'s team.\n\nCreed, who led from the pole and despite the four cautions, got the victory.\n\n"Hayden had been struggling so we just mixed it up a little bit and decided I\'d drive for him," Creed said. "And it worked out because the car was great. He\'s my best friend so I\'m just happy to get this win."\n\nCreed held off points\' leader Christian Joyce who was second with Kevin Gilbert third and Andy Southern fourth. Brad Lewis, who headed into the night second in the points behind Joyce, was involved in an early wreck but did get back on the track to get a 13th-place finish.\n\nKeaton, Andrews win in Stadium Stock\n\nGrayson Keaton held off A.J. Sanders to win the first 15-lap race in the Stadium Stock. Tyler McDonald was third and Chuck Wall was fourth.\n\nIn the second 15-lapper it was Billy Andrews winning with Pat-rick Mullen second and James Allison third. D.J. Dan was fourth with Billy Cameron Jr. fifth.\n\nTim Brown honored before races\n\nIt was two weeks ago when Tim Brown added to his lead for the most wins in track history with 100 Modified victories.\n\nOfficials honored Brown in pre-race activities, and he appreciated the gesture.\n\n"It\'s funny but since that win there\'s been a lot of people reaching out who aren\'t regular fans over here," said Brown, who lives in Tobaccoville. "I had a kid at McDonald\'s stop me and he congratulated me and I drove through Bojangles and the lady told me she was happy for me."\n\nBrown, 53, laughed when asked if he took his No. 83 through the drive thru.\n\n"No, I\'d get in trouble for that," he said. "Seriously, it\'s been fun now that we reached that 100-victory mark but like I said two weeks ago, I\'m not done."\n\nNext week\'s racing\n\nThere will be two 25-lap Modified Division races this Saturday to go along with two 20-lap Sportsman races. Also on the schedule is a 15-lap Street Stock race and either one or two 15-lap Stadium Stock races.\n\nAlso on Saturday will be the popular Truliant Federal Credit Union Night of Destruction which will include a Monster Truck crushing exhibition along with a demolition derby.\n\nPHOTOS: Bowman Gray Racing, July 13, 2024\n\njdell@wsjournal.com\n\n336-727-4081\n\n@johndellWSJ\n\nSaturday\'s Results\n\nQRC HVAC & Refrigeration Street Stock Series\n\n20 laps\n\nFINISH CAR DRIVER HOMETOWN PURSE\n\n1 05 Jacob Creed Dobson, NC 195\n\n2 1 Christian Joyce Trinity, NC 195\n\n3 13 Kevin Gilbert Mocksville, NC 115\n\n4 17 Andy Southern Lexington, NC 100\n\n5 03 Cody Gum Welcome, NC 90\n\n6 23 Jordan Atkins Kernersville, NC 80\n\n7 00 Donnie Martin Wallburg, NC 75\n\n8 35 Andy Avery Winston-Salem, NC 70\n\n9 88 Brian Shupe Lowgap, NC 65\n\n10 4 Emilee Lewis Winston-Salem, NC 60\n\n11 30 Zachary Cogar Clemmons, NC 40\n\n12 32 Joey Miller Kernersville, NC 40\n\n13 16 Brad Lewis Winston-Salem, NC 40\n\n14 8 Kyler Staley Lexington, NC 40\n\n15 9 Brandon Brown Walkertown, NC 40\n\n16 12 Nick Wall Pfafftown, NC 40\n\n17 7 Zack Staley Lexington, NC 35\n\n18 25 Bryan Sykes Jr Lexington, NC 35\n\n19 82 Justin Alveson Brown Summit 35\n\n20 21 Wes Glascoe Lewisville, NC 35\n\n21 10 Craig Hartless Winston-Salem, NC 35\n\nThe Law Offices of John Barrow Sportsman Series\n\nRace One: 20 laps\n\nFINISH CAR DRIVER HOMETOWN PURSE\n\n1 55 Zack Ore Winston-Salem, NC 315\n\n2 81 Zack Clifton Walkertown, NC 215\n\n3 7 Connor Branch Lewisville, NC 175\n\n4 0 Kirk Sheets Lewisville, NC 145\n\n5 19 Michael Adams Yadkinville, NC 130\n\n6 21 Tommy Neal Rural Hall, NC 95\n\n7 54 Braden Mills Winston-Salem, NC 85\n\n8 22 Wesley Thompson Advance, NC 75\n\n9 03 Sterling Plemmons Winston-Salem, NC 65\n\n10 31 Chase Robertson Winston-Salem, NC 135\n\n11 12 Justin Taylor King, NC 55\n\n12 51 Austin Taylor Winston-Salem, NC 50\n\n13 38 Mitch Gales Thomasville, NC 45\n\n14 11 Chase Lewis Wallburg, NC 40\n\n15 24 A.J.

More and more four-cylinder engines are popping up, with forced induction making them just as powerful as the V-shaped engines that they're replacing. This has, of course, caused quite a stir.\n\nIf you're looking for an SUV with a powerful four-cylinder, there are plenty of brand-new options hitting the market. Leading the charge, though, is Chevrolet, with an incredible turbocharged four-cylinder that makes 328 horsepower. That puts it in the same realm as some turbocharged V-6s on the market.\n\nWe take a close look at the 2024 Chevrolet Traverse, dissecting its powertrain and the benefits it has over past models. We look at just how capable the four-cylinder SUV is and what kind of performance you can expect. We also uncover some of the closest competitors to the Traverse in the everlasting horsepower wars.\n\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including the EPA and CarBuzz.\n\nReview\n\n2024 Chevrolet Traverse: A Comprehensive Guide On Features, Specs, And Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Chevy Traverse hits the midsize crossover and SUV market with an all-new look, new off-road Z71 trim, and great standard technology.\n\nThe 2024 Traverse Comes Standard With A 328 Horsepower Inline-Four\n\nClose\n\nThe outgoing Traverse had a V-6 powertrain that had a maximum output of 310 horsepower. The 2024 model enters a new generation and brings in a new four-cylinder powertrain capable of even more power while also being more efficient. This new trend of turbocharged four-cylinders is something we expect to see more often moving forward.\n\nPerformance\n\nEngine\n\n2.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four\n\nTransmission\n\n8-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n328 HP\n\nTorque\n\n326 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nFWD or AWD\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n6.7 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n130 MPH\n\nMaximum Towing Capacity\n\n5,000 LBS\n\nEvery 2024 Traverse is powered by the same 2.5-liter inline-four. This turbocharged four-cylinder is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and your choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. While maybe not as quick as some of its rivals, the Traverse still offers plenty of hustle, and you won't find highway overtaking too difficult.\n\nChevrolet offers an optional Trailering Package on the Traverse. This package can be had on every trim except the base model and will set you back an additional $650. It adds a heavy-duty cooling system, a 220-amp alternator, and a hitch view camera. This package is necessary if you want to achieve the Traverse's maximum towing capacity of 5,000 pounds.\n\nFuel Economy\n\nModel\n\nCity\n\nHighway\n\nCombined\n\nFWD\n\n18 MPG\n\n26 MPG\n\n21 MPG\n\nAWD\n\n17 MPG\n\n25 MPG\n\n20 MPG\n\nOne of the biggest claimed benefits of going with a four-cylinder over a V-shaped engine is fuel economy. The Traverse doesn't do too badly in this department, especially for a car of its size. There is only a small difference between the estimated fuel efficiency of the front-wheel drive models compared to the all-wheel drive models, so you're not penalized for going with the latter.\n\nAdd TopSpeed to your Google News feed.\n\nFollow On\n\nGoogle News\n\nDespite four-cylinders being generally more efficient, the four-cylinder in the Traverse doesn't represent that much of a difference. While you get more miles per gallon in the city, highway figures are identical to the outgoing model. However, it should be noted that the four-cylinder engine is way more powerful, so breaking even isn't that bad.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Best Four-Cylinder Vehicles In 2024 Ranked By Horsepower\n\nDiscover the top 10 four-cylinder vehicles of 2024, ranked by horsepower, blending performance and efficiency for an exhilarating driving experience.\n\nTwo High-Performance Trims Make Use Of The Engine In Different Environments\n\nChevrolet's 2024 makes good use of its high-output four-cylinder engine. While there are still everyday trims, there are two standout models that put the Traverse through its paces in different ways. The RS trim offers sporty styling elements as well as some unique tuning to make the Traverse a more exciting SUV. Meanwhile, the new Z71 trim equips the Traverse with all it needs to tackle fearsome off-road obstacles.\n\nTraverse Z71\n\nThe Z71 is a brand-new addition to the Traverse's trim lineup for the 2024 model year. It slots in right above the LS and the LT, which cater more to your average buyers. The Z71 brings some classic Chevy rough-and-tumble energy to the mid-size SUV, allowing it to travel further off the beaten path than most of its rivals.\n\nThe Z71 starts at $47,795 and comes ready to hit the trails. The first change over the rest of the lineup is that the Z71 has a slightly lifted suspension as well as all-terrain tires. More impressively, it features a standard twin-clutch four-wheel drive system, unique suspension dampening, and selectable driving modes that are terrain-specific.\n\nTraverse RS\n\nThe RS model replaces the Premier and High Country trims at the top of the ladder for the 2024 model year. With the brand-new peppy engine, Chevrolet obviously feels that the Traverse has more appeal as a sporty three-row SUV. While it doesn't come with a higher output engine, it features plenty of equipment that makes it more exciting.\n\nLooking at it from the outside, you can tell it apart from the rest of the lineup due to its 22-inch glossy black wheels and the black trim that it sports. Alongside styling elements, the RS also comes with a unique suspension tune that makes it feel a little more agile when taking corners.\n\nRelated\n\nI Took The 2024 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 In A Muddy Trail And, Unsurprisingly, It Delivered\n\nUnsurprisingly, Chevrolet managed to make the iconic Colorado ZR2 even better with this second-generation model.\n\nThe Traverse Offers Tons Of Value On The Inside As Well\n\nWhile the new four-cylinder engine under the hood of the Traverse is a treat, to be sure, its real value is only realized on the inside. The Traverse has always been one of the most spacious and comfortable mid-size SUVs out there, and the changes to the 2024 model have only helped solidify its status as the perfect family hauler.\n\nInterior Dimensions\n\nFirst Row Headroom\n\n42.6 Inches\n\nFirst Row Legroom\n\n44.29 Inches\n\nSecond Row Headroom\n\n39.96 Inches\n\nSecond Row Legroom\n\n41.46 Inches\n\nThird Row Headroom\n\n38.27 Inches\n\nThird Row Legroom\n\n32.13 Inches\n\nCargo Space Behind Third Row\n\n22.9 Cubic Feet\n\nIf you plan on driving around with a large family, then the Traverse has you covered in terms of interior space. The base trim seats up to eight people in three rows of seating, but every other trim swaps out the second-row bench for captains' chairs, reducing passenger capacity to seven.\n\nThe third row of seating is probably the most realistic third row in the mid-size segment. Where the Traverse's rivals have third rows that are only really suitable for children, even adults will be able to comfortably slide into the rear seats in Chevy's SUV. Cargo space is just as generous as seating space, with a maximum of 97 cubic feet of space with both the third row and the second row folded away.\n\nNotable Features\n\nThe most noticeable piece of tech in the 2024 Traverse is the massive 17.7-inch standard touchscreen which spans across the dashboard. This infotainment system utilizes Google's new software interface and is quick and responsive. Also standard is an 11-inch digital gauge cluster that is customizable.\n\nThere are plenty of comfort and convenience features available in the 2024 Traverse, such as a wrapped, heated steering wheel and heated front-row seats. A Bose premium audio system is also available. There is plenty of driver-assist tech that comes standard, with Super Cruise also being an optional extra.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Most Affordable Mid-Size SUV To Offer Third-Row Seats As Standard\n\nBlending affordability with spaciousness for families on a budget, the mid-size Subaru Ascent comes with standard three-row seats from the factory\n\nThere Is Some Stiff Competition From Other Four-Cylinder SUVs\n\nThe Chevy Traverse isn't the only four-cylinder SUV capable of breaking the 300-horsepower mark. There are some other really impressive options on the market. Some of these options also offer a more refined experience that is more performance-focused than Chevy's family hauler.\n\nBMW X2 M35i\n\nWhile the standard BMW X2 has an output of 241 horsepower, the M-tuned version pushes the four-cylinder engine to its limits. Instead, the M35i is capable of outputting up to 312 horsepower from its two-liter turbocharged inline-four. If you're looking for more of a sports SUV, then this is the way to go. It has upgraded brakes and a uniquely tuned suspension, as well as a punchy engine that helps rocket the X2 from a standstill to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds.\n\nFord Bronco\n\nWhile a couple of horses shy of the Chevrolet's output, the Bronco still packs a punch. The base turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four in the Bronco pushes out 300 horsepower and an impressive 325 pound-feet of torque. The Bronco is more focused on outdoor adventuring than the Traverse. If you're looking to tackle the outdoors in a mid-size SUV, then the Bronco offers some of the most fun you can have on four wheels.", 'source': {'uri': 'topspeed.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Top Speed'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'tyler_dupont@topspeed.com', 'name': 'Tyler Dupont', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1058823529411765, 'wgt': 458666275, 'relevance': 56}

But he's not popular with either group, poll analysis shows", 'body': 'WASHINGTON -- As he prepares to accept the Republican nomination for the third time, Donald Trump has promised new efforts to expand his coalition -- and, in particular, to win over more of the nonwhite voters who largely rejected him during the 2020 election.\n\nBut an AP analysis of two consecutive polls conducted in June by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that about 7 in 10 Black Americans have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Trump, as do about half of Hispanic Americans. While both groups do see Trump a little more favorably than when he left office in 2021, their opinion of him is still more negative than positive.\n\nAny gains in support among Black or Hispanic Americans would be helpful for Trump, who won 35% of Hispanic voters and 8% of Black voters in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, and has struggled to grow his appeal beyond his base. He\'s hoping, in part, to capitalize on frustration with his opponent, since President Joe Biden\'s favorability among Black and Hispanic Americans has also fallen since 2021. It\'s not clear, though, that Biden\'s loss of enthusiasm among Black and Hispanic adults is helping Trump\'s own standing among these groups.\n\nMost Americans have a negative view of Trump, according to the AP-NORC analysis, which combined two polls conducted close together to yield a bigger sample size. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults have a very or somewhat unfavorable opinion of him, while about 4 in 10 have a favorable opinion. Overall views of Trump were similar in January and July 2021, too, in the months after Biden took office.\n\nViews of Trump are generally very stable -- even a felony conviction didn\'t change how Americans see him. After he was convicted in May of 34 felony counts in New York for falsifying business documents, polls from the AP-NORC Center found that overall views of Trump barely budged. During the Trump presidency, Gallup polls found that Trump\'s average job approval rating was 41%, and it never exceeded 50%.\n\nTrump has said on the campaign trail that he has "great support" from Hispanic communities. But the AP analysis found that about half of Hispanic adults have an unfavorable view of Trump. About 4 in 10 Hispanic adults in the recent AP-NORC polls see Trump positively, up from about 3 in 10 in January 2021.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAnd even though Trump\'s campaign advisers have said he has specific appeal among Hispanic men and younger Hispanic adults because of his business focus, that\'s not what the poll analysis shows. Current views of Trump are similar among Hispanic men and women, older and younger Hispanic adults, and those with and without a college degree.\n\nBiden, too, is facing a perception problem among this group. The new analysis found that about half of Hispanic adults have an unfavorable view of him, while about 4 in 10 have a favorable view. That\'s a substantial decline from early 2021, when about 6 in 10 Hispanic Americans saw Biden positively.\n\nThe Trump campaign has claimed that he could perform better among Black adults this year than in 2020, speculating that his legal woes could endear him to a community that has faced systematic discrimination by the criminal justice system, and that his immigration policies could also hold appeal.\n\nBlack adults continue to have broadly negatively views of Trump, however: About 7 in 10 Black adults have an unfavorable view of Trump, a decrease of about 20 percentage points since early 2021. And although the Trump campaign has said Black men may be more receptive to his message, Black men and women have similar views of him.\n\nYounger Black Americans might be a little more open to Trump\'s appeals. About one-third of Black younger adults -- those under 45 -- see him positively, compared to around 1 in 10 Black adults who are 45 or older. But most younger Black adults view him unfavorably.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Black Americans, meanwhile, have a positive view of Biden -- down from 8 in 10 when he took office.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'roanoke.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Roanoke Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@roanoke.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'rebecca_blackwell@roanoke.com', 'name': 'Rebecca Blackwell', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/0f/60ffc4bf-4370-526d-b452-7cd119a9eadd/6691427d29ce8.preview.jpg?crop=709%2C372%2C471%2C53&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 458665537, 'relevance': 51}

Their first game will be against the Texas team, who beat them in the state tournament two years ago. The series concludes on July 31.\n\nAssistant coach Jeff Mayo said that the team also made it to and lost the state tournament last year, but said this season, "We finally got over the hump."\n\n"Every little kid who plays baseball says they want to play in a World Series," said designated "team mom" Mary Kathryn Allen. "It\'s just a great opportunity for them as young men."\n\nAnother assistant coach, Jim Allen, agreed that the tournament\'s personal opportunities were just as important for the boys as the athletic experience.\n\n"They get to meet kids from other areas that they wouldn\'t normally meet or interact with," he said. "It\'s not a video game."\n\nThe boys have generated some impressive statistics throughout their journey toward the World Series, such as scoring a combined 78 runs and allowing a combined nine runs in their last two tournaments.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nEleven-year-old Kendall Nappier particularly wowed his coaches and family with a .777 batting average in the state tournament. He said that one important thing he is working on with the team for the World Series is their "attitudes."\n\nBill Dawson, a pitching coach at Amherst County High School and the Amherst Youth Baseball team\'s head coach, is confident his team has what it takes to prove themselves in the World Series.\n\n"I think the strength of this team...is that they are highly competitive, which means they want to win at any cost," he said. "They lay it on the line. And it\'s not just one of them, it\'s all of them."\n\nHe explained that the boys respond to a loss by using it as motivation in future games and he admires how they always have each other\'s backs when experiencing frustration.\n\nDawson witnesses the dedication and skill of his players through coaching this team as well as the Main Street Mound Hawks, a travel ball team that eight of the Amherst Youth Baseball players are also a part of.\n\n"Our guys are really seasoned," he said.\n\nWhile the boys practice two to four times per week to ready themselves for the World Series, their parents must make certain preparations themselves. Allen shared that raising money to help with the team\'s travel, lodging and food has not been easy.\n\nWhile the Nelson County Board of Supervisors recently granted the team $5,000 after hearing a persuasive presentation from Allen, a Nelson resident who serves on the county\'s planning commission, the trip is still estimated to cost a minimum of $2,500 per player. Allen shared that any and all financial support would greatly benefit the team, and that "no amount is too small."\n\nThe team encourages people to visit their "fish fry" fundraiser on July 19, including food and bake sales, a raffle and an auction. Attendees can use cash or a check to donate toward a fish or chicken dinner with two side options such as mac n\' cheese, corn on the cob, baked beans and coleslaw.\n\nThe event will run from 4 to 8 p.m. at the Massies Mill Ruritan Club in Roseland. All proceeds will help fund the team\'s trip to Louisiana.\n\nThe group also has a GoFundMe that is currently accepting donations.\n\nHarper Lawson\n\nhlawson@newsadvance.com\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

One of my earliest hockey memories was watching Brett Hull score 50 goals in 50 games when I was five years old. I spent so much time on inline skates in my driveway or in nearby church parking lots that a wheel fell off my Roller Blades and I broke my finger in the fall. I also played ice hockey from kindergarten through high school. And when I was indoors, I played NHL \'95 on my SEGA. But then I went to college in a small town with no ice rink, and then moved around a bit before ending up in Seattle with no car, very little money, and very little storage space. For 13 years, hockey was just something I did when I was younger.\n\nBut then I became a dad and bought an electric cargo bike to haul the kid around. During those long days at home with a baby, I had to find excuses to get out of the house and move my body. I needed something that didn\'t involve work or being a dad or worrying about all those other adult responsibilities. I was watching a Blues game with the kid sleeping on my shoulder when I realized that with the cargo bike I could probably ride my stuff to hockey rinks. My parents shipped my old high school hockey gear to Seattle and I signed up to play in a local beer league (although I don\'t think they want us to call it that). It\'s a no-hitting adult league that is now called the Kraken Hockey League, although I signed up before the city had a team and before the rink at Northgate was built. I went to an evaluation skate, got "drafted" to a team, and have been playing with them ever since. Other than breaking another finger, it\'s been great. It\'s a planned physical activity for after the kids go to bed, where I can fully immerse myself in the fresh air for an hour and a half, followed by a relaxing bike ride home late at night.\n\nMost of our games are at rinks in Mountlake Terrace, Lynnwood, and Northgate, with the occasional game in Kent and Everett. I bike to almost every game at the first three rinks, and I\'ve biked to Kent Valley Ice Center twice. But Everett has always been the rink where I borrow a car or carpool with a teammate. When people see me outside a rink with my gear and poles on my bike, they always ask me, "Do you bike to every game?" And I\'ve always said, "Well, I\'ve biked to every rink except Everett." But not anymore.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWednesday night, as my husband and kiddo were beginning their bedtime routine, I packed my gear into the bike, plugged in both batteries, and set out on the 30-mile ride along the Interurban North bike trail from Seattle to Everett. Not only was this the first time I\'d ridden all my hockey gear this far, it was also the first time in years that I\'d ridden the Interurban North past Lynnwood. It\'s a great route, even if it\'s not complete. There are a few significant detours to miss freeway intersections, but the signs are mostly easy to follow. I only turned around a handful of times, but each time it was quickly apparent that I was going the wrong way. Google\'s bike routes, which seem to be getting worse and worse, didn\'t always follow the official route accurately, but the physical signs along the route were reliable. If you do ride this route, trust the signs instead of Google.\n\nThe ride there was thankfully uneventful, although I did expend more power than necessary by keeping the power setting on the bike low, worrying about whether I would have enough battery power to get home later that evening. As it turns out, I didn\'t need to. The Tern GSD had more than enough range to use the higher power settings for the entire 60 mile round trip, especially since I had brought the charger so I could plug in the batteries while I was out on the ice.\n\nI could have really used some extra leg power and energy for the game. There were only three of us on defense, so our shifts were about 50% longer than normal. Hockey is a brutally exhausting sport, and somewhere in the middle of the second period I cracked. I had no more calories to burn and my legs just couldn\'t recover during the short breaks on the bench. By the end of the game I could barely keep going. Two and a half hours of riding (and maybe not enough food) for the extra long shifts was too much. As I slowly stripped off my gear in the locker room afterwards, my legs feeling like jelly, it hit me that I still had 30 miles to ride before I could get home and go to sleep. It was 12:30 am by the time I got back on my bike. I had already eaten all my emergency fruit snacks. Time to get pedaling.\n\nThe good news was that while my legs were tired, none of my joints were sore. I can sometimes get knee pain when riding long distances, but my knees behaved themselves. Even more good news was that my bike\'s computer estimated that I could keep the e-assist motor in "turbo" and make it home with energy to spare. So I did. But even with the assist, it still takes energy and stamina to pedal. On top of that, my back and butt hurt, and my core was exhausted. I wasn\'t sure I was going to make it, but I didn\'t have any other easy choices. I\'m also extremely stubborn and more than a little stupid. So I persevered and put on old Sonic Youth albums on the bluetooth speaker to keep my energy up.\n\nThe Interurban North bike trail largely follows the former route of the Everett-Seattle electric passenger train (1910-1939). Remember that scene in Fremont with the people and the dog with the human face waiting on a platform? That\'s the train they\'re waiting for. And if you\'ve never noticed before that the dog has a human face, I\'m so sorry I ruined your life. Once you see it, it\'s all you can see. I\'m a monster for writing this paragraph. This is the punishment for getting this far in a meandering essay about biking to hockey.\n\nMost of the ride is on sections of trail built on old railroad tracks. It\'s also a somewhat unusual corridor because much of it is owned by the electric companies. Over the years, several sections have been built over by residential or retail development, freeways or freeway ramps. Municipalities, along with King and Snohomish Counties, have been trying to patch it back together for decades, but the long stretches of trail that do exist are truly a delight. Yes, you spend a lot of time with I-5 roaring by, but the trail is mostly tree-lined and feels almost like a secret path. Most of the on-street sections are either on very quiet side streets with little traffic, have bike lanes, or have a widened sidewalk that serves as a trail. There are a few unfriendly sections, such as the section at NE 205th Street near the county line (The North Sound Bicycle Advocates are on it!), but the only truly awful ride on the street was the Maple Road Bridge over I-5 in Lynnwood, which has only narrow shoulders next to sidewalks that are far too narrow to bike on (there\'s even a sign at the beginning of the bridge saying bikes are not allowed on the sidewalks). It\'s the only part of the entire ride where I\'d be afraid to take a child.\n\nThere are a few projects in the works to make the route a little better, but I can\'t find any active projects to improve the Maple Road problem (let me know in the comments if I\'m missing something). Snohomish County currently has a survey going on about a project to improve walking and biking conditions south of Everett that is worth filling in. Snohomish County will also build a path connection from 160th Street SW to 167th Place SW next year a section where there are now only narrow cycle paths.\n\nAbout an hour into my drive home, it was 1:30 a.m. and I had barely seen anyone else. I was starving and felt ridiculous for not bringing more food. I had planned to stop at a fast food restaurant along the way, but I hadn\'t seen one yet. I was starting to worry that everything would be closed this late on a Wednesday night deep in the suburbs. The trail veered away from the woods and led me onto a street, another detour onto the street before I got back to the trail. And then I saw it. It was hard to believe it was real. A 24-hour Subway? I had no idea such a thing existed. But there it was, and it was beautiful.\n\nI ordered an Italian footlong and sat down at a table. I had been riding on adrenaline and Sonic Youth for a while and I finally realized how exhausted I was as I sat down and waited for my sandwich. My legs had barely any strength left. I wolfed it down when it was ready and immediately felt a lot better. The guy working alone that night was impressively patient as drunk people kept stumbling in from the bar a few doors down. He didn\'t get upset or frustrated at all when he had to repeat himself over and over to get people to place their sandwich orders. He just let it take as long as it took and made sure people got fed. He kept the city of Lynnwood together that night.\n\nI can\'t even tell you what was in the sandwich I ate, because I wasn\'t looking at it as I devoured it. However, I could feel the energy coursing through my body and at least some strength returning to my legs. I still had about an hour and a half to go, but now I knew I was going to make it. I queued up Teen Age Riot and pressed play, then continued cycling south.\n\nIt\'s time to go around\n\nA one-man showdown, teach us how to fail\n\nWe are now off the streets\n\nAnd back on the road, on the riot trail\n\nThe rest of the ride was tiring, but went as smoothly as it could. It\'s funny how familiarity with a route makes it seem shorter. For example, I got to Mountlake Terrace and thought, "Oh, good, I\'m almost home," even though I knew I had almost an hour to go. But at least I knew all the hills, turns, and bumps from there on out.\n\nI rolled home at 3am. It felt great to flop down on the couch. I had done something ambitious on impulse, and I had made mistakes and taken unnecessary risks. It was the kind of adventure I haven\'t had since I got older, always planning everything to make sure everyone is taken care of. I did something stupid, and I loved it.', 'source': {'uri': 'exbulletin.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ExBulletin'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.02745098039215688, 'wgt': 458652915, 'relevance': 60}

It is a legal twist that Erie County\'s top attorney admits he didn\'t see coming.\n\n"I want to be real public about the team deserving credit for stepping in ... and coming to a conclusion that, quite frankly, I missed," Erie County Attorney Jeremy Toth said.\n\nAnd that means more money - upward of $9 million - will be flowing into the community under the terms of a Community Benefits Agreement that is expected to pump more than $100 million in initiatives backed by the settlement over the next 33 years.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Now the committee is prioritizing coming up with a system to make sure the money is being properly allocated, which will include public participation in the process to better understand the most pressing needs.\n\nBut when the agreement was reviewed by the new legal team of the Bills that includes Terry Gilbride and Toni Cannady, they determined that the language about the community funds was actually tied to the beginning of stadium construction, which started last year.\n\nWhy the fresh look?\n\nJust about every Bills employee who negotiated the original new stadium deal is no longer with the team - that is staff on the business side, including in the legal department.\n\nGilbride came from the Buffalo law firm Hodgson Russ earlier this year to become senior vice president and chief legal officer with the Bills, and Cannady serves as the team\'s assistant general counsel.\n\nToth said it is not unusual that a new set of eyes reviewing a contract would notice something "everyone else had taken for granted, to that point."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStop and look: How the new Bills stadium is already drawing in spectators\n\nThe Buffalo Bills new stadium project site has been an attraction from the start of construction last June, but this summer may become an even more prime time for fans, sightseers and neighbors to come out as the stadium really begins taking shape, the weather gets even warmer and school is out until the fall.\n\n"I think the Bills\' lawyers just read what we drafted and what we wrote, and what we agreed to had the investment beginning commensurate with the execution of the documents, and so there\'s the construction period ,and then there\'s the 30-year lease period," Toth said.\n\nThat also partly explains why the New Stadium Community Benefits Oversight Committee, which oversees the community investment, wasn\'t able to review the team\'s allocation during the first year of the stadium deal. The group also didn\'t form until too late in the process.\n\n"That\'s why, at the beginning of all this, there was a little bit of a scramble," Toth said.\n\nGoing forward, committee members said at a meeting Monday that they want to make sure area residents have more input into where the Bills allocate those millions of dollars in the years to come.\n\n"We will now help in how those funds are allocated," said the Rev. Mark E. Blue, the committee chair. "We did not have a say in it this time, but we will develop a formula for how things can be done, and funds allocated going forward."\n\nThe cost of the new Bills stadium keeps rising. Will fans have to pick up the tab?\n\nWill all the money really come from the wallet of Bills billionaire owner Terry Pegula or should season ticket holders expect to at least share in those costs?\n\n"Not saying they were done unjustly or unfairly, but we just don\'t know," he added. "Now that we do know, we\'ll be more proactive."\n\nThe team is confident it made at least $3 million in fund allocations for continuing and new initiatives in the community and in workforce development efforts from March 29, 2023, to March 28, 2024.\n\nFor now, though, the committee isn\'t sure what all those investments were. The specifics on where that money went will be documented in an annual report that is to be released July 29.\n\n"It will highlight not only where the community investment went, but also all of the effort as it pertains to making sure that the team is staying active with the community and supporting the various spaces and needs," said Penny Semaia, vice president of stadium relations for the Bills.\n\nOnce the report comes out, Toth said committee members will evaluate and respond to the Bills\' community investments. The committee is slated to meet Aug. 12.\n\nBlue said the committee will come up with a system to make sure the money is being properly allocated, which will include public participation in the process to better understand the most pressing needs for it. But the Bills have the final say in determining where the funds are allocated each year.\n\n"Will they be disappointed? Will they be enthusiastic? I don\'t know," Toth said.\n\n"And how does that play into next year?," he asked. "It\'s important that the public understand that the committee doesn\'t have any direct authority over this money, but the Bills are not going to ignore them. We set this up with the expectation that the Bills wouldn\'t be interested in fighting with a bunch of community members."\n\nToth said that there are no other NFL teams with a setup like this one, and he feels that if both parties work together for a common purpose, the accomplishments could be "extraordinary." But the process will take at least the next few years to evolve, because there is no blueprint for it, he added.\n\n"If it works effectively, it\'s going to be a partnership between this community group and the Buffalo Bills, and as long as there is good will and good faith on both sides, I think it is going to be a real exciting and interesting development for this community," Toth said.\n\n0 Comments Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

The 16-year-old was, according to several reports, attracting the eyes of scouts at many of Europe\'s major clubs.\n\nThe name had been popping up in football discourse for a few months at this stage. He was, by all accounts, a hugely talented prospect. His coaches in his native Moldova couldn\'t speak highly enough of him. Reports of his performances on the field pointed to a generational talent with the potential to dominate European football for years to come. It was only a matter of time before one of Europe\'s giants swooped in to make the youngster an offer he simply couldn\'t turn down.\n\nThere was only one very small issue with the hype surrounding the teenager. The young Moldovan was merely a figment of a Mayo journalist\'s imagination.\n\nDuring the mid-noughties, the football transfer market was developing into the carnival of gossip and general silliness it continues to be known for today. Any given day would provide a new rumour that was in all likelihood built on idle chatter at best and, at worst, subterfuge. Ballinrobe man Declan Varley had become both intrigued and frustrated by the colourful tapestry of rumours that were churned out in a bid to whet the appetite of fans as the club game recessed for the summer months.\n\nIt led Varley, who is currently editor at the Galway Advertiser as well as being a celebrated author, to an idea - he was going to devise a social experiment that would explore just how far a rumour could travel. Though the true power of the internet had not yet been realised, there were already subtle signs to suggest misinformation could be propagated fair and wide. He began by coming up with the name Masal Bugduv. It was based on M\'asal Beag Dubh, which translates as My Little Black Donkey, a short story by renowned Galway author and journalist Pádraic Ó Conaire.\n\nAs an avid Arsenal fan, it was only natural that he would attempt to connect his club with the apocryphal footballer. He began by posting the rumour online on football fan blogs. But the football universe was soon eating the hoax up.\n\nFootball fans were, as is their wont, consumed by the idea of Europe\'s next young talent arriving at their club. More worrying though was the manner in which sports media, too, took the bait hook, line and sinker.\n\nAs always, the devil was in the detail. So, Varley carefully manufactured a fake backstory, including bogus quotes from people supposedly close to the teenager and reports of his exemplary performances on the field. These details were then posted online, drop by drop, allowing the rumour mill to do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe prodigy, fans were told, had made his debut for Moldovan side Olimpia Balti as a 15-year-old and had already scored a hat-trick in a cup game. His rise was so rapid that he had already made his senior international debut during his country\'s 2-2 draw with Armenia in May 2008. There were also reports of his participation in his country\'s World Cup qualifier with Luxembourg.\n\nThe fabrication\'s tentacles continued to grow and the Bugduvt\'s name soon began appearing in mainstream media.\n\nReputable outlets such as The Times and The Guardian began reporting about the manner in which clubs were advancing on the teenager in the hope of securing his signature. The Times ranked him as one of the world\'s best 50 young footballers. It didn\'t take long until respected "sources" were endorsing the talent. His fictional agent was also seen leaving Arsenal\'s training ground, telling reporters: "I have no doubt that he has the ability of Fabregas and Nasri, but he needs a stage to perform and prove this."\n\nVarley sat back and watched the drama unfold. He had cast the net, the fish did the rest of the work.\n\nA short while later, with no move for Bugduv coming and no sight of the teenage sensation in London, Munich, Milan or Madrid, some investigative journalists finally began to do some digging of their own and unearthed the hoax.\n\nThough Varley initially kept his silence, he eventually came forward to unveil the reasoning behind such a cunning scheme. In an interview with the New York Times, he explained how he came up with the ruse, drawing a correlation between Ó Conaire\'s donkey and the transfer market. The protagonist in Ó Connaire\'s short story "knows his donkey is useless", he said. "But [he] tries to sell it to the highest bidder."\n\nThe entire affair served as a cautionary tale for both sports journalists and football fans who consumed football content relating to their respective clubs like it was written on tablets at the summit of Mount Sinai. Journalists at reputable outlets had been exposed for failing to maintain acceptable standards of accuracy - Bugduv\'s tale laid bare how speed and the power of an eye-catching headline regularly came at the cost of truth.\n\nBut the affair also reminded readers that they have a duty to approach rumour with a sense of healthy scepticism, just as Varley did when encountering unreliable gossip day after day.\n\n"People will believe what they want to believe," Varley told the New York Times. "And there is a desire to be seen as though you are in the know, not to want to admit you aren\'t on top of the game." Alas, it could be argued that the world of football remains as gullible as ever, despite Bugduv\'s notorious rise to fame. Football has merely become a by-product of the internet, where anyone can choose what they want to believe and point to multiple supposedly reliable sources to back up their beliefs.\n\nAs former Google CEO Eric Schmidt once noted, the internet is "the largest experience in anarchy that we ever had".\n\nVarley merely exposed that fact before the rest of us had caught up with reality.', 'source': {'uri': 'westernpeople.ie', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Western People'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.westernpeople.ie/cms_media/module_img/7482/3741411_7_org_Masal_20Bugduv.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'wgt': 458648486, 'relevance': 26}

Then, a gold medalist. A deserter of the Cuban team. A migrant. A maintenance worker. And a refugee.\n\nNow, he continues to rocket along on his narrow red-and-white canoe, this time flying past suburban homes in the canals winding through Cape Coral, Florida.\n\nKneeling on his boat, his oar slices through the air as his coach chants "very good work, very good work" from a boat next to him.\n\nJorge\'s eyes are fixed ahead, throwing all his force into his third Olympics.\n\n"After having written off the 2024 Paris Olympics, it\'s a massive opportunity," he said. "There are so many Cubans that come to this country and lose this dream of competing once again, simply because they don\'t know how to get back to this place."\n\nJorge was at the top of his career, having won gold in Tokyo for the 1,000-meter canoe sprint, when he took a daunting step in March 2021. While training in Mexico, Jorge defected, joining a growing number of Cuban athletes in deserting their country amid an ongoing migratory flight.\n\nSome hope to make more money than they can in the communist-run island. Others, like Jorge, say they left because of political differences over how the government treats citizens and athletes.\n\nHe left behind his home and crossed into the United States via the Rio Grande, in hopes of a better -- if uncertain -- life.\n\nArriving to Florida was, in some ways, like starting from scratch. Granted refugee status in the U.S., Jorge said he would wake up hours before sunrise to train, then work eight hours in a maintenance gig to pay his bills.\n\nHe said he watched friends forced to give up everything after migrating, but he fought to continue as a professional athlete.\n\n"I had a hard time getting out of bed every day and keeping my head on straight," he said. "I had no support whatsoever."\n\nBecoming one of the first Cubans to compete on the Refugee Olympic Team changed everything for him, he said. Still, he is among those who\'ve struggled to cover the costs of competing internationally. He opened a GoFundMe page in June to help pay his way to the Games.\n\nCuba has protested the inclusion of Jorge and Cuban weightlifter Ramiro Mora on the team, saying they should not be considered refugees.\n\nToday, Jorge\'s life in Cuba and his future in Florida seem to blend together in his home. His red, blue and white Cuba jersey sits framed over his doorway, while medals from competitions in the U.S. hang over a statue of the Olympic emblem.\n\n"To the refugees and athletes who\'ve been through the same thing, I want to tell them to not give up," he said. "No matter how dark the days become, the sun is always going to rise."\n\nManizha Talash, Afghan, breaking\n\nManizha Talash does not fear the Taliban.\n\n"I\'m here because I want to reach my dream. Not because I\'m scared," she declared from Spain, where she was granted asylum.\n\nOn the outskirts of Madrid, the 21-year-old is training hard for the Games, which for the first time will include breaking, or, as it\'s popularly known, breakdancing. Talash prances and swivels on her hands and feet to the beat of hip-hop, swooshing her black and red hair around before striking a pose signaling the end of her performance.\n\nJust months ago, she was working in a hair salon in the town of Huesca. Talash was among hundreds of Afghans brought to Spain aboard military planes following the return of the Taliban to power in August 2021.\n\nTalash first came across breaking at age 17. She saw a social media video of a man spinning on his head and was skeptical -- it must have been fake, generated by AI, she thought. But the images were real, and she said she soon became obsessed with the sport, scrolling through video after video on her phone.\n\n"I wanted to do it, I wanted to learn it," she said.\n\nShe found a club in Kabul where a dancer from the videos trained and knocked at the door. "There were 55 boys, and I was the only girl," she said. "I told myself, why can\'t a girl do this?"\n\nBreaking in some ways freed her from the problems facing young women in Afghanistan. But it wasn\'t long before Talash was noticed -- international news outlets published stories about the young Afghan woman defying cultural and religious norms. That was enough to become a target.\n\n"The Taliban don\'t like it when a girl dances," she said, even though breaking is more than that -- it\'s a sport.\n\nHer club began receiving threats, Talash said, and one day, when a bomb hit very close, local police asked them to shut down over the dangers.\n\nShe trained behind closed doors in her home until the Taliban\'s return to power. Despite initial promises that women\'s rights wouldn\'t be curtailed, women have since been barred from studying and face several restrictions on employment, travel and health.\n\n"Now, girls can\'t do anything," Talash said.\n\nShe\'s had little time to train while adapting to a foreign country, and at some points, competing in the Games seemed unfathomable.\n\n"But when my friend told me I could join the refugee team, I was so happy," Talash said. "I can now fly."\n\nMohammad Amin Alsalami, Syrian, athletics\n\nWhen Mohammad Amin Alsalami arrived in Berlin in October 2015, he was cold, lonely and homesick.\n\nThe Syrian refugee had left behind his war-torn hometown of Aleppo, fled to Turkey, crossed the Mediterranean on a rubber boat to Greece, and trekked by foot to Germany. Like millions of other migrants, he was in search of a place where he could build a future without bombs and violence.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Alsalami, 29, has been granted asylum, learned German and made new friends. And he\'s living his dream of becoming a world-class athlete.\n\nHe learned just months ago that he got the green light to participate in the Paris Games.\n\n"That moment was so wow," he said. "I get to go to the Olympics. I cried so much. It was really cool."\n\nAlsalami discovered his passion for athletics during physical education in school at age 15. A teacher noticed his talent for long jump and pushed him to participate in local and national competitions in Syria. But when civil war erupted, he could no longer practice. His family -- he\'s the youngest of nine siblings and comes from a family of tailors -- was displaced several times within Syria, then fled to Turkey. Alsalami decided to continue on to Europe on his own.\n\nHe credits his passion for athletics with getting him through the initial hardships in his new country.\n\nDuring the first weeks in Berlin, he looked up different stadiums and gyms on Google maps so he could start practicing long jump again. He remembers walking through the first snow to finally discover one of the city\'s big indoor gymnasiums.\n\n"All the other Berlin track and field athletes were training in this hall," he said. "When I came in and saw how full and how warm it was inside ... it was almost like paradise for me."\n\nOn that first day, a man watched him jump, approached him and asked something in German.\n\n"I didn\'t understand anything, not in English either," Alsalami said. "And then I said \'Hey, I\'m Syrian\' on my cellphone, and he said \'I\'m your trainer from now on.\'"\n\nHe stayed with that first coach for five years, then moved on to a different one -- and said he\'s eternally grateful to both for their support.\n\nDespite his excitement for the Games, Alsalami admits he\'s a bit sad that he can\'t represent his home country.\n\n"Syria is home, I miss it every day," he said. "In the end, that\'s my country, that\'s where I come from."\n\nIman Mahdavi, Iranian, wrestling\n\nIman Mahdavi smiles and dishes up Iranian food that he\'s cooked himself at his Milan home.\n\n"If my mum could see me now," he said with a laugh. "She wouldn\'t believe it."\n\nMahdavi hasn\'t seen his mother since October 2020, when the Iranian wrestler fled his home country over fears for his life.\n\nWith only the clothes he was wearing, Mahdavi made a harrowing journey by foot from Iran to Turkey, then flew to Italy and applied for asylum.\n\n"I didn\'t even really know where I was flying to," said Mahdavi, 29. "Luckily for me, it was Italy."\n\nOnce he was granted asylum, one of Mahdavi\'s first aims was to continue wrestling. His father, once a wrestler himself, had instilled in his son a passion. Mahdavi became a seven-time national junior champion and won more than 50 medals.\n\nThrough a friend he connected with on Instagram, Mahdavi was introduced to a gym on the outskirts of Milan.\n\n"As soon as we had him in the gym, in his first training sessions, we immediately saw that he was an extraordinary athlete, that he was a very, very high-level wrestler," said Giuseppe Gammarota, president of Lotta Club Seggiano. "We immediately started preparing him for competitions."\n\nThe gym has become like family to him -- so much so that he calls his coach, Marco Moroni, "Papi."\n\nMahdavi said his real father died of a heart attack several years ago after being mistakenly told his son died in a car crash.\n\nIt was Moroni who helped Mahdavi find a job, as a nightclub bouncer.\n\nMahdavi admits the schedule can be tough: He works from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., goes home to sleep, then trains every day. But he has a focus that drives him.\n\n"The Olympics is a dream for any athlete who does any sport," he said. "I hope to come back from the Olympics with the best colored medal I can get. And I will also be thinking about the next Olympics, hoping I\'m still in form."\n\nAssociated Press journalists Rebecca Blackwell and Daniel Kozin in Cape Coral, Florida, and Iain Sullivan in Madrid contributed to this report.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'pantagraph.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'pantagraph.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'megan_janetsky@pantagraph.com', 'name': 'Megan Janetsky', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pantagraph.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/85/a8543f5d-04f0-5bc8-8761-e67b014aa38a/669375a046ae8.image.jpg?crop=600%2C315%2C0%2C62&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9725114', 'sentiment': -0.04313725490196074, 'wgt': 458636864, 'relevance': 26}

Know truth behind viral claim', 'body': 'India TV Fact Check: A video claiming an accident involving the Vande Bharat train is being circulated on social media. India TV\'s fact-check team has investigated this viral video.\n\nLast month, the Kanchanjunga train accident occurred in Darjeeling, West Bengal. In this accident, 9 people died, and over 30 were seriously injured. Following this train accident, it is being claimed that the Vande Bharat train has also met with an accident. A video with this claim has been uploaded on the social media platform Facebook. The video was uploaded from an account named "Naresh Bihari Official," which has over 13,000 followers. Along with the video, the caption read, "What happened to the Vande Bharat?" In this video, a white train is seen climbing over a freight train after an accident. People are sharing this video, believing it to be true.\n\nWhat is the truth behind the claim of the Vande Bharat train accident? India TV\'s fact-check team has conducted a thorough investigation. The team searched the screenshots of the video shared on the "Naresh Bihari Official" Facebook account using Google Reverse Image. Several photos and links to news websites related to this train accident emerged. One link led to India TV\'s English website, which had a news article titled "Chile: At least two killed, several injured as Chilean train on test run collides with cargo train | VIDEO." This article contained the same photo as the one in the video uploaded on the Facebook account.\n\nUpon opening the link to the news article on India TV\'s English website, it became clear that the incident was not related to the Vande Bharat train. On June 20, 2024, a train accident occurred in Chile, South America. In this accident, 2 people died, and many were injured. The train involved in the Chilean accident was white, resembling India\'s Vande Bharat train. The video of the Chilean train accident was being shared on the Facebook platform, falsely claiming it to be the Vande Bharat train.\n\nAdditionally, the India TV fact-check team found another video related to this incident from the news agency Associated Press. This video was uploaded on the Associated Press YouTube channel. The Associated Press video, dated June 20, 2024, reported that at least 2 people died and 9 others were injured in a train collision in Chile.\n\nThus, the video of the train accident that occurred in Chile on June 20 is being falsely shared on social media platforms with claims about the Vande Bharat train. India TV\'s fact-check team has found the claim of the Vande Bharat train accident shared by "Naresh Bihari Official" to be completely false. No Vande Bharat train has met with any such accident.', 'source': {'uri': 'indiatvnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'India TV News'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/fact-check-4-1720938222.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2392156862745098, 'wgt': 458635612, 'relevance': 51}

For Velazquez, it was a weekend that marked a year since he was a first round draft pick in the 2023 MLB Draft.\n\nThey each reached base in the game and Chourio drove in the American League's lone run with an RBI single up the middle in the fourth inning. The National League Futures team won 6-1, getting a home run from Cincinnati Reds prospect Cam Collier, who took home MVP honors.\n\nChourio started in left for the American League, getting two at-bats and driving in Yankees prospect Spencer Jones during the second. Velazquez pinch hit in the plate appearance after Chourio's RBI single and drew a walk. He struck out in his at-bat later in the game.\n\nThe two joined local college standouts Kyle Teel, the former Virginia catcher who was selected in the first round by the Boston Red Sox last season, and Gavin Cross, who played for Virginia Tech from 2020 to 2022 and is in the Kansas City farm currently.\n\nChourio is the 85th ranked prospect in baseball, per MLB Pipeline, while Velazquez is just behind him at No. 87. The two were the first Hillcats to appear in the game since Nolan Jones was selected for the 2019 edition.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDuring the first game back home in Lynchburg, Wuilfredo Antunez stepped into the No. 2 spot in the lineup and notched two hits, driving in the first of three runs for the Hillcats in the fifth inning that helped open up its 5-1 lead. Antunez scored Tommy Hawke with the ninth triple of his season, and Esteban Gonzalez, who currently leads the Hillcats in OPS, drove in Antunez with a double one batter later\n\nThe start by Clemmey was a continuation of a nice stretch of starts for the 2023 draftee. On Saturday, he tossed 4⅓ innings while allowing three hits and the lone Delmarva run in the top of the fifth. He fanned six batters and walked just one.\n\nParra allowed no hits in his 2⅔ innings of work and picked up his second win of the season.\n\nIn Saturday's nightcap, the Hillcats offense worked nine walks off of Delmarva pitching and needed just five hits to collect eight runs. Two more Lynchburg pitchers combined to hold the Shorebirds to three hits again to pick up the 8-2 win.\n\nThe Hillcats wasted no time scoring in the first, putting three straight runners on after the Shorebirds retired the leadoff batter. Rafael Ramirez Jr. grounded out to plate Christian Knapczyk, who would go on to lead Lynchburg on offense in the game.\n\nKnapczyk tallied just one hit -- a double in the sixth that extended the Lynchburg lead to 6-0 -- but he worked a trio of walks, drove in three runs and scored twice himself.\n\nDelmarva worked a pair of runs off of Josh Harlow in the seventh, both unearned, after a Lynchburg error in the frame. Yorman Gomez got the start and worked five innings while allowing two hits. He fanned five batters and walked three while picking up his sixth win of the season.\n\nHarlow struck out five in two innings and allowed just one hit.\n\nThe Hillcats (48-38, 11-9 second half) will close out their week with Delmarva on Sunday, with first pitch set for 2 p.m., and then enjoy a midseason break as MLB holds its All Star festivities.\n\nAfter Sunday, they will return to action on Friday on the road against the Carolina Mudcats.\n\nBryson Gordon, (434) 385-5529\n\nbgordon@newsadvance.com\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Sponsored by Strack & Van Til.\n\nA well-groomed white horse with a silky mane named Beauty caused a stir in downtown Whiting Saturday, attracting many onlookers and photographers and causing passing cars to stop to get a better look or snap a quick pic.\n\nAn avid horseman was getting married at St. John the Baptist Church on 119th Street Saturday afternoon.\n\nHe had wanted to involve his horses in the wedding ceremony but couldn\'t so the women in the wedding party brought in a horse and carriage to surprise him, horse trainer Tamara Nevinger said.\n\n"The groom in the wedding is a horseman and was upset he couldn\'t have any of his courses so the gals got together to surprise him with this. He has no idea," she said. "It\'s for a nice little photo shoot so he will have a horse in his wedding photos outside the church. It was important to his family."\n\nAntique Coach and Carriage from Homer Glen supplied the horse and carriage for a photo op outside the church. The firm has brought horse-drawn carriages to weddings, quinceañeras, birthday parties and other special occasions across Northwest Indiana and Chicagoland since 1985.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\n"We\'ve done jobs in Michigan, even Iowa," Nevinger said. "We\'ve been to this same church before. We do a lot of jobs in Chesterton at the Sand Creek Country Club."\n\nThe spectacle of setting the horse up on 119th Street drew a crowd of the curious before it trotted over to the Catholic church. Beauty is a Percheron, an elegant French draft horse breed that\'s often used in harness racing. It\'s one of 10 horses that Antique Coach & Carriage keeps in its stables.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"She does light duty and gets requested for weddings because she\'s white," Nevinger said. "This should be emotional for him because of how much horses mean to him so it\'s going to be fantastic for him to see that horse. All the women in his family are doing this for him to make his day extra special."\n\nPeople often choose to surprise unsuspecting loved ones with horses at weddings, Nevinger said.\n\n"It\'s either for pizzazz or for the horse lover who\'s missing having their horse in whatever celebration they\'re doing. It\'s like having a dog lover or a cat lover. Horse lovers are the same. You just can\'t bring the horse anywhere. Just having a horse here will do a lot with him."\n\nThe horses usually turn heads when out trotting around in public, Nevinger said.\n\n"They always get attention when people see a horse on the street," she said. "Horses are one of those beautiful things that people just admire."\n\nWeddings account for about 35% of Antique Coach & Carriage\'s business, owner Debbie Hay said.\n\nHay said she sometimes gets jokes about how on-the-nose her surname is given her line of business but said it\'s from a Scottish clan she descended from. She said the firm also does cotillions, sweet sixteens and festivals.\n\n"If you wanted to have a carriage for like Pierogi Fest, we\'d come out," she said. "We\'re open year-round."\n\nA look back at Northwest Indiana businesses that closed in 2023\n\nA look back at Region businesses that closed in 2023\n\nLocal News Alert Top Story Urgent Beer Geeks craft beer bar in Highland closes, to reopen as B-Side Bar & Lounge Joseph S.

The rare timed quest "Fortunate Son" can lead to losing a character permanently if it\'s not completed almost immediately, adding urgency players may not expect. Saving Scooter in "Fortunate Son" unlocks a touching scene and exclusive song, making it worth prioritizing for impact.\n\nTaking too long to complete one Cyberpunk 2077 mission could lead to the permanent loss of a recurring character. For all its open-world interactivity, Cyberpunk doesn\'t actually have many timed quests or world events. For the most part, players can complete all its main and side jobs in whatever order they wish. But it is possible to lock oneself out of certain content, either by doing certain quests in the wrong order, or by making the wrong Cyberpunk story choices at important moments.\n\nEven so, there are a few timed quests in Cyberpunk, including one that could ruin the entirety of the Phantom Liberty DLC. Their rarity actually makes them more dangerous: the player is naturally conditioned to expect the plot will wait for them. But that\'s not always the case, especially in the case of one particular side job. Its particulars do suggest the need for urgency, but other than that, the game doesn\'t make its time-limited nature totally clear. And that can lead to disaster.\n\nRelated\n\nPhantom Liberty Fixed Cyberpunk 2077\'s Biggest Open-World Issue\n\nCyberpunk 2077\'s open-world suffered from repetitive side-content; an issue that was redressed by Phantom Liberty multilayered gigs.\n\nThe Cyberpunk Side Job "Fortunate Son" Is Secretly Timed\n\n"Fortunate Son": Time Limit & Consequences\n\nClose\n\nThe "Fortunate Son" side quest in Cyberpunk has a secret timer, and one of the involved NPCs can die if the player isn\'t fast enough. This side job begins immediately after "Queen of the Highway," an important step in Panam\'s Cyberpunk 2077 questline. Talk to Bob at the nomad camp, and he\'ll explain that one of his buddies - Jake Scooter - needs a kidney, and fast. He has a lead on a cybernetic implant that could save Scooter, but it\'s all the way across town in Little China.\n\nSo V has to race across Night City in order to pick up the kidney implant, then bring it back to Bob. There are some additional wrinkles, and if the player sees things through, they\'ll learn that the police installed a virus in the implant in an effort to catch a completely different group of nomads. As long as V figures that out and explains it to Bob, he\'ll be able to uninstall the virus and save Scooter. However, it\'s easy to mess this job up long before then: take more than 24 hours to get back to Bob with the kidney, and Scooter will die.\n\nOf course, it shouldn\'t take anywhere close to 24 hours just to get to Little China and back. Instead, this hidden time limit is meant to punish players who put "Fortunate Son" off. As a result, it\'s important to watch the preceding scene carefully, and take the urgency of Scooter\'s condition into consideration. But as long as V heads out almost immediately, they\'ll get back in plenty of time, and get a nice little reward for it further down the line.\n\n2:01\n\nRelated\n\nCyberpunk 2077 Player Finds A Way To Date Every Romanceable Character At Once\n\nCyberpunk 2077 had restricted its romance options in the past, but one player has found a way to date all of the game\'s love interests simultaneously.\n\nCompleting Cyberpunk\'s "Fortunate Son" Unlocks A Touching Scene Later\n\nPlus, A Hidden Reference To The Star Ending\n\nIf Scooter is saved during "Fortunate Son," he\'ll appear later to serenade the Aldecaldos camp. Scooter has a pretty varied repertoire: he can play "The Beast of Beauclair," a boss theme from The Witcher 3\'s Blood and Wine expansion, and one of many Witcher references littered throughout Cyberpunk. He can also sometimes be heard covering fictional in-universe band Us Cracks, who can be heard on the radio throughout Night City. Their rivalry with Kerry Eurodyne also eventually plays into his personal quest.\n\nBut if V decides to ally with the Aldecaldos during "Nocturne Op55N1," they\'ll unlock an additional quest called "We Gotta Live Together." Check in on Scooter during that job, and he\'ll sing an entirely different kind of song. It\'s a tragic ballad about a rootless boy whose wanderings lead him into a deadly gunfight. There are obvious parallels to many of the game\'s most tragic figures, and the Aldecaldo nomads themselves, but the melody is borrowed from the game\'s score.\n\nThe same tune plays during "Pyramid Song," the final job in Judy Álvarez\'s storyline - the narrative about a person forced to wander after their home is destroyed makes perfect sense in the context of Judy\'s life. It also plays during The Star ending, which V has to unlock in order to hear Scooter\'s cover.\n\nSo, while Scooter isn\'t the most central character in the story, saving him does unlock a sweet scene, and a beautiful song exclusive to The Star ending. Either way, it\'s worth prioritizing "Fortunate Son" in order to save Scooter\'s life in a timely manner. It\'s one of very few time-limited quests in Cyberpunk 2077, but it leaves a lasting impact either way.\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\nBased on the 1988 tabletop game, Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person action RPG game set in a dystopian cyber future developed by CD Projekt Red. Players will tackle the streets of Night City as customizable protagonist V, who struggles to keep their memories intact after receiving a strange cybernetic implant that slowly overrides their memories by a deceased celebrity known as Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves.\n\nPlatform(s) PC , Xbox One , Stadia , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox Series S , Xbox Series X\n\nReleased December 10, 2020\n\nDeveloper(s) CD Projekt Red\n\nPublisher(s) CD Projekt Red\n\nGenre(s) RPG , Action\n\nEngine REDengine 4\n\nESRB M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Use of Drugs and Alcohol\n\nHow Long To Beat 25 Hours\n\nMode\n\nMetascore 75\n\nPS Plus Availability N/A\n\nSystem Google , PC , PlayStation , Xbox\n\nExpand', 'source': {'uri': 'screenrant.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ScreenRant'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'lee_d@screenrant.com', 'name': 'Lee D', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/johnny-silverhand-in-the-foreground-with-judy-panam-from-cyberpunk-2077.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9735152', 'sentiment': -0.02745098039215688, 'wgt': 458603809, 'relevance': 6}

He was also castigated during a provincial board meeting.\n\nIn last Wednesday\'s Senate hearing, Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian said he personally believed that Capil gave special treatment to the Lucky South Pogo hub.\n\nThe mayor denied being a Pogo supporter and said that he even refused to issue a business permit to Lucky South in January this year. He earlier argued that it was the responsibility of the state gaming regulator, Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), not local governments, to monitor Pogo activities.\n\nIn a "Manifesto of Support for our Porac Chief Executive" posted on the Facebook page of the local newspaper, Punto, on June 28, all the 29 barangay chairs of the town said they believed Capil was not involved in any irregularity in relation to the Pogo company and that he was also responsible for making their town more progressive.\n\nThe manifesto was reposted on the official Facebook page of Porac town and its Public Information Office later on the same day.\n\nA rarity in Porac\n\n"We reject and disprove all baseless attempts against his leadership, to discredit his personality and character that will weaken the confidence and trust of his constituents in this Pogo crisis," said the manifesto signed by the village chiefs.\n\nAn identical statement also was signed and released by all the 29 leaders of Porac\'s Sangguniang Kabataan.\n\n"I am sincerely grateful to you for your support," Capil said during a meeting with the village chiefs on Thursday. "This is rare in the municipality of Porac when all village chiefs support their mayor. This is the first time it has happened."\n\nDuring a hearing called by the Senate committee on women, children and family relations a day earlier, Capil was questioned by Gatchalian about his office\'s supposed inaction on the alleged illegal activities at the Lucky South compound and the nearby Hotel Royal leased by the Pogo company.\n\nSen. Risa Hontiveros, the committee head, said Capil did not respond to a July 19, 2021, letter from Police Maj. Arvin Hosmillo, the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group chief for Pampanga, who reported alleged serious illegal detention, cybercrime, prostitution and illegal drug activities going on at Hotel Royal, formerly known as Hotel Aramis.\n\nThe mayor repeatedly insisted that he did not receive the letter.\n\n\'Convenient excuse\'\n\nWhen Hontiveros pointed out that the letter had a receipt stamp from the municipal government, Capil replied: "I am sorry but, in all honesty, I didn\'t get that letter. If I had only received it, I would have taken action."\n\nHontiveros described Capil\'s answer as "regrettable" and Gatchalian called it a "very convenient excuse."\n\nCapil also said that there was no Hotel Royal in his town.\n\nBut Google Maps and Google Street Views show that the hotel is located beside the 10-hectare Lucky South compound and the Royal golf course, which is on the Porac side of the 106-ha Royal Garden Estate that straddles Angeles City and Porac.\n\nThe Angeles City business permit and licensing division had no Royal or Aramis Hotel registered in its system, indicating that it is outside its jurisdiction, according to a staff who spoke with the Inquirer on condition of anonymity for not being authorized to speak with the media.\n\nNo knowledge\n\nHosmillo\'s letter to Capil, which was coursed through the Porac\'s municipal business permit and licensing office, said that "Royal Hotel (is) located at Pulung Maba, Sta. Cruz, Porac," which is also the location of Lucky South.\n\nCapil also told the senators that he did not know about the alleged crimes at Lucky South.\n\nHe read from a "comprehensive report" by the Porac police that it had received eight separate "intelligence reports" from May 2023 to March 20, 2024 about alleged criminal activities in buildings operated by Lucky South but found no irregularities or crimes committed upon inspection.\n\nFormer Pampanga police director Col. Levi Hope Basilio reported on March 24 that the Porac Pogo hub was being used for human trafficking, kidnapping, cybercrime and prostitution.\n\nBut Porac officials only took action on his report in May. They, however, failed to conduct a proper inspection as the Lucky South authorities refused to allow them to enter the estate.\n\nPink shirts for Alice\n\nIn Bamban, about 22 kilometers from Porac, there was no similar manifesto from local officials for its suspended mayor, but hundreds of residents wearing pink shirts rallied on June 8 to express support for her. Some carried placards saying, "We love you, Mayor Alice."\n\nPosters expressing support for Guo were displayed on electric posts and fences along the town\'s major roads.\n\nElected officials, including Vice Mayor Leonardo Anunciacion, the acting mayor, councilors and village chiefs have chosen to keep a collective silence on the issues facing the mayor, including questions about her true nationality and her alleged involvement in Pogo operation.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ordered the freezing of Guo\'s assets as the Department of Justice investigates a PAOCC complaint of qualified human trafficking against her and 13 other respondents allegedly involved in the Bamban Pogo, Zun Yuan Technology Inc., which was padlocked in March.', 'source': {'uri': 'newsinfo.inquirer.net', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Inquirer.net'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jun_a_malig@newsinfo.inquirer.net', 'name': 'Jun A.

Massive family movers weighing well over 4,000 pounds are able to outrun the fastest supercars from just five years ago while maintaining a substantially lower price tag.\n\nThe downside, however, is that they don't really reach that high top speeds because of their high curb weights, transmission, and battery limitations. There are some SUVs that can reach impressive top speeds by electric car standards, while still comfortably seating multiple passengers with a host of comfort and safety features.\n\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including Edmunds, Car and Driver, and MotorTrend. We've ranked the models below based on their top speed figures, from slowest to fastest.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Fastest Mainstream AWD Electric Cars In 2024\n\nThere is no dearth of EVs in the market, be it RWD or AWD, and here are the 10 fastest mass-market AWD EVs that you can buy in 2024.\n\n10 Genesis GV60 Sport Plus\n\nTop Speed: 146 MPH\n\nThe Genesis GV60 Sport Plus trim features a dual permanent-magnet motor configuration, affording it a 146 MPH top speed and 4.0-second 0-60 MPH claimed acceleration time. Independent reviews reveal that you can cover this sprint in around 3.9 seconds.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual permanent-magnet motors\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n483 HP\n\nTorque\n\n516 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n4.0 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n146 MPH\n\nTowing Capacity\n\n2,000 Pounds\n\nPayload Capacity\n\n2,039 Pounds\n\nDespite producing 483 horsepower and 516 pound-feet outputs, this smaller EV only tows 2,000 pounds, but it can carry a more generous 2,039-pound payload.\n\n9 Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 SUV\n\nTop Speed: 149 MPH\n\nMercedes-Benz handed its mid-size EQE executive electric SUV to its AMG department, which has yielded some impressive results. With the optional Dynamic Package fitted and in launch control mode, the dual-motor configuration produces 678 horsepower and 738 pound-feet.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual Permanent-Magnet Motors\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n678 HP\n\nTorque\n\n738 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n3.2 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n149 MPH\n\nTowing Capacity\n\n3,500 Pounds\n\nPayload Capacity\n\n1,279 Pounds\n\nIn this state, it will sprint from 0-60 MPH in a claimed 3.2 seconds until it hits its 149 MPH top speed. The luxurious SUV can also tow up to 3,500 pounds with a 1,279-pound payload capacity.\n\n8 Tesla Model Y Performance\n\nTop Speed: 155 MPH\n\nThe Model Y Performance honors its title thanks to Tesla front AC induction and rear permanent-magnet motor configuration. This affords it a combined 456 horsepower and 497 pound-feet output, resulting in a claimed 3.5-second 0-60 MPH time and 155 MPH top speed.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nFront AC Induction and rear permanent-magnet motors\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n456 HP\n\nTorque\n\n497 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n3.5 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n155 MPH\n\nDue to the nature of its drivetrain, you can't use the Model Y for towing purposes, so it is a relatively limited crossover option. It does benefit from some of the best interior packaging, so it's not too bad of a mild utility vehicle.\n\nRelated\n\nThe 10 Lightest Electric Cars On The Market In 2024\n\nIf you're looking for an EV with lower curb weight figures, these are the only options you should be looking at.\n\n7 BMW iX M60\n\nTop Speed: 155 MPH\n\nThe BMW iX M60 is the brand's flagship all-electric model, featuring a pair of motors that the Bavarian company's M-division has specially tuned. The performance EV SUV generates a combined 610 horsepower and 811 pound-feet, resulting in a 3.2-second 0-60 MPH time and 155 MPH top speed if you opt for the Driver's Package.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual-Permanent-Magnet Motors\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n610 HP\n\nTorque\n\n811 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n3.2 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n155 MPH\n\nTowing Capacity\n\n5,512 Pounds\n\nPayload Capacity\n\n1,003 Pounds\n\nThis is BMW's first step into high-performance electrification in a premium SUV, and while the design may divide a lot of fans, there's no denying its performance is very impressive. It can also haul an impressive 5,512 pounds while towing and carry a 1,003-pound payload.\n\n6 Porsche Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo\n\nTop Speed: 155 MPH\n\nNow, this might seem controversial since the Cross Turismo is more likely a wagon than an SUV, it cannot be classified in the same category as the standard Taycan, which is why we decided to add it to this list. Porsche transformed its Taycan Turbo S into a crossover by increasing the ride height and adding some plastic cladding. Thankfully, it retains the dual motor configuration, which produces 750 horsepower and 818 pound-feet.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual Permanent-Magnet Motors\n\nTransmission\n\nTwo-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n750 HP\n\nTorque\n\n818 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n2.4 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n155 MPH\n\nThis is all it needs to get from 0-60 MPH in 2.7 seconds before it hits its limited 155 MPH top speed. Unfortunately, you can't use the Cross Turismo for towing, but its generous rear section can more than accommodate larger items.\n\nAdd TopSpeed to your Google News feed.\n\nFollow On\n\nGoogle News\n\n5 Kia EV6 GT\n\nTop Speed: 161 MPH\n\nThe Kia EV6 GT is the second-last South Korean EV SUV we feature on this list, which is an impressive feat considering how the Hyundai Group is relatively late to the high-performance game. This E-GMP-based EV features a pair of electric motors that generate 576 horsepower and 545 pound-feet.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual Permanent-Magnet Motors\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n576 HP\n\nTorque\n\n545 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n3.5 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n161 MPH\n\nTowing Capacity\n\n2,300 Pounds\n\nPayload Capacity\n\n937 Pounds\n\nKia claims that this sleek EV will cover a 0-60 MPH sprint in 3.5 seconds and reach a limited 161 MPH top speed. Independent reviews prove that it can cut its sprint time down to 3.2 seconds. Its 2,000-pound towing capacity and 93-pound payload capacity add to its versatile appeal.\n\nRelated\n\nThe 10 Most Value For Money Electric SUVs On the Market Today\n\nWith the market continuing to grow, these 10 electric SUVs offer plenty of features and capabilities for their respective price tags.\n\n4 Porsche Macan Turbo EV\n\nTop Speed: 162 MPH\n\nPorsche's all-new fully electric Macan Turbo doesn't waste any time in making a name for itself when pitted against its rivals. The top-of-the-range variant features the brand's dual-motor configuration, affording it a 630-horsepower and 833-pound-feet state-of-tune.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual Permanent-Magnet Motors\n\nTransmission\n\nTwo-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n630 HP\n\nTorque\n\n833 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n3.1 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n162 MPH\n\nTowing Capacity\n\n4,400 Pounds\n\nPayload Capacity\n\n1,200 Pounds\n\nThis will get you from 0-60 MPH in just 3.1 seconds and hit a top speed of 162 MPH, making it even faster than its lower-riding Cross Turismo sibling. You can also use this high-performance EV to tow up to 4,000 pounds and carry 1,200 pounds worth of cargo in the trunk.\n\n3 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N\n\nTop Speed: 162 MPH\n\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is a purpose-built performance electric SUV, which is pretty much the first of its kind. Hyundai has evolved its N division, which is why we now have access to a 641-horsepower and 568 pound-feet electric SUV that can cover 0-60 MPH in just 3.25 seconds.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nDual Permanent-Magnet Motor\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n641 HP\n\nTorque\n\n568 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n3.25 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n162 MPH\n\nHyundai limits the top speed to 162 MPH, which sounds relatively low considering it's a full-on performance model. However, you need to consider that this EV prioritizes lap times and handling characteristics. This is something many reviewers highlight that the Ioniq N achieves with composure.\n\n2 Tesla Model X Plaid\n\nTop Speed: 163 MPH\n\nThe Tesla Model X Plaid features the Model S's triple motor configuration, producing an identical 1,020 horsepower and 752 pound-feet output. Despite this, it can't hit the same numbers as the brand's halo model.\n\nPerformance Specifications\n\nMotor Setup\n\nTriple AC permanent synchronous motor\n\nTransmission\n\nSingle-Speed Automatic\n\nHorsepower\n\n1,020 HP\n\nTorque\n\n752 LB-FT\n\nDriveline\n\nAll-Wheel Drive\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n2.5 Seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n163 MPH\n\nTowing Capacity\n\n5,000 Pounds\n\nPayload Capacity\n\n1,115 Pounds\n\nTesla claims its largest EV will sprint from 0-60 MPH in 2.4 seconds before reaching its 163 MPH limited top speed. While impressive, this is substantially lower than the Model S Plaid's 205 MPH top speed figure. Thankfully, you can use this to tow up to 5,000 pounds and carry a 1,115-pound payload.\n\nRelated\n\nEco-Friendly Family Fun: Best Electric SUVs For Busy Parents\n\nFind out which SUVs are the most practical for families, have plenty of space for passengers and baggage, and are easy on the environment.\n\n1 Lotus Eletre R\n\nTop Speed: 165 MPH\n\nIt's quite fitting that Lotus's first-ever SUV features an electric drivetrain.

Many of whom will be listing tickets on the \'unofficial\' resale websites that pay to top Google search,\' Webb said.\n\n\'None of the tickets on these websites are guaranteed, and some probably won\'t even exist.\n\n\'It\'s hugely frustrating that Google continues to support and amplify this black market. Thankfully, the new Government has committed to protect fans by taking further action against touts - including the capping of resale prices. That action can\'t come soon enough.\'\n\nEuropean football\'s governing body UEFA had also issued warnings to fans over the use of authorised websites and social media sites.\n\nUEFA stressed that fans could be at risk of having tickets cancelled or be refused entry if they have not bought tickets through their official portal.\n\n\'Tickets purchased from unauthorised third parties, websites or agencies, as well as on social media sites, or from touts may be cancelled by UEFA at any time and fans are likely to be refused entry or be ejected from the stadium,\' UEFA stated ahead of Euro 2024.\n\n\'Moreover, under certain laws, unauthorised sale of match tickets may constitute a criminal offence and is a matter that UEFA takes very seriously.\n\n\'UEFA actively enforces its ticketing terms and conditions and, in fact, several hundred tickets have already been cancelled ahead of the UEFA club competition finals and UEFA EURO 2024 as they were offered and/or transferred in breach of the ticketing terms and conditions.\'', 'source': {'uri': 'internewscast.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Internewscast Journal'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-England-fans-scramble-to-be-a-part.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9727822', 'sentiment': -0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 458587157, 'relevance': 32}

Low honor leads to a bad ending with betrayal and violence, while high honor offers a more peaceful conclusion. The epilogue allows players to continue as John Marston, seeking revenge and closure after Arthur\'s story ends.\n\nIt\'s hard to believe that Red Dead Redemption 2 is almost six years old -- it was released on Oct. 26th, 2018. In the game, players follow Arthur Morgan, a Van der Linde gang member, traveling across the Wild West, robbing people, fighting other outlaws, and hunting animals. RDR2 lets players do so many things, both good and bad.\n\nThroughout the game, players will have a variety of choices to make. Depending on what they do, it will affect their "Honor." If players do good deeds, such as saving people from being attacked or being kind to strangers, their honor will go up. If they do evil things, such as shooting innocent people or just being plain old rude, their honor would go down. It will affect a lot depending on how far their honor will go. How Arthur would talk to people on the streets, some of the latter choices, and even which ending of the game players would achieve.\n\nEnding 1: Getting the Money Back (Low Honor)\n\nIs the Money Really Worth the Backstabbing?\n\nPlayers agree that this is the definitive bad ending. Players must have Low Honor and choose to get the money.\n\nRelated\n\nHow to Unlock Red Dead Redemption 2\'s Bonus Ending (and What It Means)\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 offers an emotional bonus ending for those players who go the extra mile. Here\'s how to unlock it.\n\nWhile the Honor System does affect how the ending is played out, there is still one choice in the story that lets players decide which direction the ending goes. In the final mission, Arthur and John confront Dutch and Micha, trying to convince the former of the latter\'s betrayal. Dutch hesitates to decide, giving the Pinkertons plenty of time to run up and start shooting. During the escape, players will have one last choice to make. They can leave John and go back to the hideout to grab the money, or they can go with John and make sure he can get home to his wife and kid.\n\nIf the player chooses to go back to the hideout, they are locked into the game\'s "bad" ending. Arthur will tell John that he\'s heading back. While John protests, Arthur gives John his hat and tells him to leave and be with his family. This where the honor system comes into play. Players will return to the hideout and grab the money that was locked in the chest. Once they leave the cave, they will be attacked by Micah and start one last fistfight. Throughout the fight, Arthur will start to get wobbly. His tuberculosis is winning.\n\nIf the player\'s honor level is low, Micah will stab Arthur in the chest. Before it can go any further, Dutch will come to stop the fight. Arthur will try one last time to convince his old friend that Micah is the reason everything went downhill. It seems that Dutch will have some clarity and start walking away from the situation, much to Micah\'s dismay. Arthur starts to crawl away, only for Micah to run up to him and stab him in the back, finishing Arthur off. At the end, players will see a wolf, symbolizing Arthur\'s low honor.\n\nEnding 2: Getting the Money Back (High Honor)\n\nMoney Is Still Not Worth It\n\nWhile the ending is still similar, some things do change throughout it. As in the previous one, players will have to choose to go back to the hideout to grab the money. This time during the fight against Micah, right before Arthur gets stabbed, he bites Micah\'s hand, separating the two before Dutch gets involved.\n\nArthur brings up a better argument to Dutch about how Micah has betrayed them. This time, while Dutch walks away from everything, so does Micah. Arthur then tries to get back to his feet, but it seems like all of his strength is gone. He looks up to a break in the trees, where the sun rests on him. He lies back down on the ground and passes away. The players will see a deer, more specifically a stag, right before the credits start.\n\nWhile this one is better than the worst ending, the way Arthur dies can be seen by fans as a bit anti-climactic. To just pass away with the view of the sun between the trees doesn\'t feel like Arthur\'s grand send-off players would hope for. Luckily for players, there are a couple more endings that they can get.\n\nEnding 3: Helping John (Low Honor)\n\nIt\'s All About Family\n\nRelated\n\nDoes Red Dead Redemption Need a Live-Action Adaptation?\n\nConsidering that it\'s one of the most popular games of all time, it\'s worth considering whether Red Dead Redemption needs a live-action adaptation.\n\nDuring Arthur and John\'s escape from the Pinkertons, the player will have a choice between going back to the hideout to get the money or go help John escape to reach his wife and child. The obvious morally correct choice is to go and help John. Players will find themselves in one last shootout on top of a cliff. After killing a few Pinkertons, Arthur realizes that he can\'t go on anymore. He tells John to leave and that he\'ll hold them back. John protests, but Arthur knows that both of them won\'t make it. He gives John his hat and tells him to run to his family.\n\nAfter John heads out, the player will have to shoot a couple of more Pinkertons, to make sure John makes it. But unknowing to both the player and Arthur, Micah sneaks in from behind and attacks him. Here they get into one last fistfight. By this point, Arthur\'s tuberculosis is hindering him greatly. Near the end of the fight, Arthur crawls towards a gun that is on the ground, but once he reaches it, Dutch steps on Arthur\'s hand.\n\nArthur pleads with Dutch, telling him how Micah betrayed them. Micah tries to refute this, but Dutch doesn\'t know what to do or who to believe. He leaves Micah and Arthur, leaving both of them in a state of confusion. Micah is furious. He walks up to Arthur and shoots him in the face at point-blank range. Arthur dies unceremoniously in the cold, wet rain.\n\nEnding 4: Helping John (High Honor)\n\nArthur Finds Inner Peace\n\nClose\n\nFans agree that this is the true ending of the game. Players must have high honor and help out John.\n\nThis ending is similar to the last one. However, when the player has high honor, it changes a lot. Running through the canyon, shooting Pinkertons, and having a one-on-one fight with Micah is still the same. But when players get to the very end, when Dutch leaves, Micah does so as well, leaving Arthur by himself. He starts to crawl through the canyon. Once he makes it to a certain point, he rests, watching the beautiful sun across the land as he passes away.\n\nFans consider this to be the true ending of the game. How Arthur passes, the location and the sight of where he passes give fans some closure. During the post-game, this is the location of where his grave will be.\n\nThe Epilogue Ending\n\n"It\'s Over, Abigail. It\'s All Over."\n\nRelated\n\n10 Things You Didn\'t Know About John Marston\'s Past in Red Dead Redemption\n\nJohn Marston\'s life is revealed across Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2, but fans may have missed out on aspects of this outlaw\'s past.\n\nWhile Arthur Morgan\'s story has ended, players will get to continue the game as John. They will play through John building his house, finish any unfinished quests, and get revenge on Micah. The final story mission for John finds him, Sadie, and Charles starting to climb up a mountain because they find out that Micah has been hiding up there. During the climb, Charles gets injured and has to be left behind.\n\nThey will fight against plenty of Micah\'s men. Near the top, Sadie gets injured, leaving John by himself to confront Micah. After the two exchange a few words (and Micah threatens John\'s family), the two start shooting it out. During the fight, Sadie will sneak in and try to corner Micah, only to be quickly taken hostage once Dutch enters the fray. John, Micah, and Dutch have a stand-off. Micah pleads with John to join them in starting a new heist, while John is trying to settle the situation.\n\nAfter a bit, Dutch turns on Micah, shooting him, and setting Sadie free. The player will have one more chance to shoot Micah a bunch of times before he finally dies. Dutch will make his exit, leaving the chest full of gold and money for John to have. As the team goes back down the mountain, they cut back to John\'s house, where he tells his wife, Abigail, that it\'s all over.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nPlayed from a first- or third-person perspective, the game is set in an open-world environment featuring a fictionalized version of the United States in 1899.\n\nPlatform(s) PS4 , Xbox One , PC , Stadia\n\nReleased October 26, 2018\n\nDeveloper(s) Rockstar Games\n\nPublisher(s) Rockstar Games\n\nGenre(s) Action , Adventure\n\nMultiplayer Online Multiplayer\n\nEngine RAGE\n\nESRB M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Sexual Content, Strong Language, Use of Drugs and Alcohol\n\nHow Long To Beat 50 Hours\n\nMetascore 97\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nSystem Google , PC , PlayStation , Xbox\n\nExpand', 'source': {'uri': 'cbr.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBR'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jullian_brown@cbr.com', 'name': 'Jullian Brown', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/red-dead-redemption-2-horse-trick.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 458586653, 'relevance': 6}

James wished for Leonard\'s good health, hoping he would take care of himself ahead of the 2024-25 NBA season.\n\n"He\'s a brother of ours. He\'s part of the fraternity, no matter if he\'s here or not. He has to take care of himself and that\'s all that matters."\n\nKawhi was the most accomplished star on Team USA behind the big three of James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant. The two-time Finals MVP did participate in internal scrimmages last weekend before dropping out of the camp and being replaced by Derrick White.\n\nWhite\'s inclusion has been controversial, as he was picked ahead of teammate and reigning Finals MVP Jaylen Brown. LeBron reacted to White\'s inclusion on the team.\n\n"What can Derrick White add? Just poise, his ability to guard, his ability to shoot the ball. Bringing in another championship DNA guy, it\'s great"\n\nJames seems to be on board with White being the replacement, as the low-maintenance and versatile guard would allow Team USA to not upset the team\'s internal chemistry by adding another star player. But given how all NBA stars are buying into specific roles for the Olympics, it\'s unfair to suggest that Brown couldn\'t have provided a spark while fitting into the team\'s overall plans.\n\nAll the options would be worse than a healthy and engaged Leonard, who averaged 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 3.6 assists last season as he was named to the All-NBA Second Team. It\'s unclear what his health status going into the season will be, as Leonard couldn\'t compete in the 2024 Playoffs due to injury before also dropping out of Team USA.\n\nWithout Paul George by his side next season, Leonard\'s regular season load will be heavier as well. He must take this summer and focus on himself, as Leonard inches closer to most believing he\'ll never rediscover the health he enjoyed earlier in his career.\n\nStephen Curry Was Sad To See Leonard Being Unable To Play For Team USA\n\nThe news of Leonard dropping out of Team USA was upsetting to many veteran stars on the roster. LeBron focused on hoping Leonard would take care of himself before the season started, and Stephen Curry also weighed in on the news.\n\nCurry praised Kawhi for trying his best before understanding why the USAB, Kawhi, and the Clippers took the decision to sit him out for the Olympics.\n\n"Kawhi gave it everything he had when we were preparing the last few days of camp. There were conversations between USAB leadership, Kawhi, and his team to make sure he was set up for success."\n\nThe 33-year-old Leonard might not get another shot at representing Team USA at the Olympics. While Kevin Durant could lift his fourth Gold medal this Olympics, Leonard has never been part of a medal-winning Olympic roster. Kawhi was part of the USA Select Team in 2012 and competed against LeBron and Durant on the main team, but didn\'t play in the 2016 or 2020 Olympics.\n\nWhether Leonard can represent Team USA at the age of 37 in 2028 is unknown, though the chances of the same look slim already with pundits wondering if Leonard is headed towards retirement.\n\nRelated: Grant Hill Explains Why Kawhi Leonard Left Team USA\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

He quarterbacked teams to the AFL championship game five times in the first six years of the league. He won with the Bills in 1964 and 1965. He lost in the title game in \'60 and \'61 with the Chargers and in \'66 with the Bills. He was the title game MVP in \'64 and \'65. He was the AFL MVP for the \'65 season. He was 65-37-3 as a starter, which speaks to his greatness as a field general and leader. He has the most total passing yards in AFL history with 21,218.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He had a cannon and was a superb downfield passer. He led the AFL in yards per attempt in \'60 and \'64, was second in \'61 and third in \'63.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nAnother strength: Kemp was a fine runner. He scored 40 career rushing touchdowns, second in pro football history at the time of his retirement behind Otto Graham\'s 44. Now Kemp is fifth in career QB rushing TDs (Cam Newton is first with 75, Josh Allen second with 53).\n\nMy opinion is Kemp is in the "Hall of Great," but is not a Hall of Famer. My biggest reason is Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame sportswriter Larry Felser never strongly advocated for Kemp to be enshrined. Felser liked and greatly respected Kemp, but didn\'t think he quite made the grade. Felser\'s mission was to get guard Billy Shaw elected, which happened in 1999.\n\nThe No. 1 reason the Bills won back-to-back titles was their great defense, which led the league in fewest points allowed in \'64, \'65 and \'66. The best element of the \'64 offense was the rushing game, which ranked No. 1 thanks to Cookie Gilchrist. Kemp was brilliant amid a slew of offensive injuries in \'65. But again, the defense led the way, and the passing game ranked seventh (out of eight) in the AFL. Kemp was ninth, sixth and seventh in passer rating index in the AFL from \'64 to \'66.\n\nThe Buffalo-area voter on the Hall of Fame selection committee is Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Famer Vic Carucci. Carucci is a strong supporter of Kemp\'s candidacy, for all the positive reasons outlined above. The Hall of Fame is subjective. The pool of senior candidates is deep, but Kemp still has a shot.\n\nJames Cook hosts three days of kids football camps: \'Giving back is always good\'\n\nCampers ages 6 to 16 spent a few hours on the field running through different drills, and even getting to play some seven-on-seven with Cook, who played quarterback throughout the day.\n\nEd Helinski asks: What\'s your opinion on why Shaq Lawson hasn\'t been signed by the Buffalo Bills or anyone else? Has his ship sailed and his pro football career gone kaput?\n\nMark: Lawson played 30% of the defensive snaps last season and managed just one sack. He is 30. He still can play. NFL teams could do worse than him, but he is a No. 5 defensive end at this point, and hasn\'t been as effective as he was in 2019 in Buffalo when he had a career-best 6.5 sacks.\n\nLawson is a stout edge defender against the run. The Bills essentially replaced him - and they hope upgraded a bit - when they gave a one-year contract to Dawuane Smoot. He is 29 and 6-foot-3, 275 pounds. Big. He had between five and six sacks for four straight years from 2019 to 2022. He had just one sack for Jacksonville last year while playing 30% of the snaps.\n\nBills position preview: Front office runs it back at tight end\n\nThe position is looked at as a strength of the roster heading into the 2024 season, which will be offensive coordinator Joe Brady\'s first full season on the job in Buffalo.\n\nThe Bills face some tough rushing teams this season, starting with the opener against Arizona, which was fourth last year in rushing. Baltimore, Miami, Indianapolis (probably), Detroit and San Francisco are other tough run teams on the schedule. The Bills are going to need the stout Smoot on the edge in those games, especially. Expect Smoot and Casey Toohill to rotate between No. 4 and No. 5 at defensive end, depending on the matchup.\n\nJeffrey Miller asks: A non-Bills question, but certainly in their interest. What is the contract situation with Travis Kelce? How much does he make and for how long? Because the Chiefs have so much vested in Patrick Mahomes, as the Bills have with Josh Allen, will they be able to afford him "perpetually?" And at what sacrifice to the rest of the team? Of course, you know what answer I\'d like to see.\n\nMark: You\'ll be happy to know Kelce turns 35 on Oct. 5. You\'ll be unhappy to know great tight ends Tony Gonzalez and Jason Witten were mostly great through their age-37 season. Antonio Gates started to tail off at age 35. Shannon Sharpe was great through his final season at age 35.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nKelce had 93 catches last season, third-most among tight ends. He\'s making $17 million a year, tops at the position, and his deal runs through 2025.\n\nKelce\'s contract is a bargain, because he is the No. 1 weapon in the offense. So while his contract is big, it is relative peanuts compared with wide receivers who are by far the No. 1 target in their offenses. Minnesota\'s Justin Jefferson averages $35 million a year. Cleveland\'s Amari Cooper, the 20th-highest paid wide receiver according to Spotrac.com, makes $20 million a year. Jacksonville\'s Gabe Davis makes $13 million a year, tied for 28th.\n\nYou could argue that the value they\'re getting from their No. 1 receiving weapon puts them $10 million to the good versus most other teams in the league. (This also is a reason why if Dalton Kincaid can keep ascending, he could be a big, long-term value for the Bills, even on a second contract. But that\'s a story for a year or two from now.) The Chiefs easily could get out of the Kelce deal after this season, but why? It is far more likely he has another good year and they extend him.\n\nThere s a better chance that Kelce has age-related injury issues the next couple years than he becomes cost-prohibitive to the Chiefs. But that is probably wishful thinking for Bills fans. Kelce has missed five games in the last 10 years.\n\nWhy Bills trust Quintin Morris in any role at tight end\n\nAs the No. 3 tight end on the active roster, Morris has to be prepared to step in for either Dawson Knox or Dalton Kincaid, who are used in different ways.\n\nEric Kollig asks: Straight up, do you think Josh Allen will win Buffalo its first Super Bowl? And: Was there one commonality that stopped the 1990s Bills from winning one? Or was it individual differences each year?\n\nMark: I\'d be lying if I told you my crystal ball is any better than yours on the Super Bowl over the next 10 years. As long as Allen is healthy, the Bills should be in the hunt to win the AFC title for the next eight years or so. Let\'s talk short term. If you told me Von Miller or Greg Rousseau were getting 12 sacks this year, I would say the bar for the Bills is making the Super Bowl. The Bills will be in good cap shape in 2025. I\'d say their Super Bowl chances will be even better in 2025 than 2024.\n\nAs for the Super Bowls, how much time do you have? The biggest reason they didn\'t win Super Bowl XXV was their defense played a bad game against a bland offense, which stayed on the field 40 minutes. If the defense gets just one more third-down stop, the Bills probably win. After that, the Bills\' defense was inferior to great opposition defenses. The Bills\' defense ranked 19th, 14th and fifth in points allowed the last three Super Bowl seasons (and were 27th in yards in 1991 and 1993). The opposing teams\' defenses ranked second, fifth and second in points allowed those three years. (The Giants were first in 1990). The Bills couldn\'t stop the Cowboys\' power-run game. In fairness, Dallas had one of the greatest running backs and offensive lines of all time. Give the Bills credit for getting past Dan Marino (twice) and John Elway in the absolute prime of their careers from 1990 to \'92.\n\nBills position preview: Stoutness of middle three looks like asset for offensive line\n\nThe middle three is looking just as stout if not stouter this season. Connor McGovern moves over to center to replace Mitch Morse, and David Edwards takes over at left guard.\n\nEdward Doody asks: Do you know if the new Bills field will be big enough to host major international soccer events? Would they be able to lay sod over the turf? It would be nice to have a USA venue that is not also a home crowd for team Mexico.\n\nMark: It would be big enough. Numerous NFL stadiums also host MLS teams, including Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Soldier Field in Chicago. The international requirement is 110 to 120 yards long by 70 to 80 yards wide. The NFL field is 120 yards by 53.5 yards. (Actually, the FIFA "recommendation" is 114 by 74 yards, but there\'s wiggle room.) New Highmark Stadium will have natural grass. We\'d be talking a North American (CONCACAF) match or an international friendly. Whether Buffalo would or could lure such an event - given there are 27 MLS markets with a far better track record of supporting soccer - is uncertain.\n\nEric Tichy asks: Is it just me or do Bills receivers with Allen not have a lot of YAC? So often it seems receivers have to make a play for the ball rather than make a catch in stride and rack up yards afterward.\n\nConnor McGovern is \'going back home\' to center on Bills\' offensive line. Here\'s why that matters\n\nThe Bills love what they saw last season from Connor McGovern, who they signed in March 2023 as a prime free-agent acquisition from Dallas. And while McGovern gives Morse proper respect, he has no apprehension about moving from guard to center this season. "I would say center is my natural position," McGovern said. "So it\'s just going back home."\n\nMark: The answer is yes. In 2021, Brain Daboll\'s last year as coordinator, the Bills were 32nd in average YAC yards per catch (4.2), according to Sportradar. In 2022, they were 26th in total yards after catch and 26th in YAC yards per catch (4.37).\n\nIt got better last year. The Bills improved to 15th in total yards after catch with 2,046, according to Pro Football Focus and ranked tied for 20th in YAC yards per catch (5.1).\n\nThe Bills got better receiving production out of running back James Cook, tight end Dalton Kincaid and slot receiver Khalil Shakir. Stefon Diggs led the Bills in YAC, but his total was just about the same as the previous year.\n\nCook had 405 yards after catch, compared with 259 by Devin Singletary in 2022. Cook\'s YAC per reception was 9.2, 12th best among backs with at least 20 catches.\n\nShakir had 286 yards after the catch and an average of 7.3 yards after catch per reception. That ranked third best in the NFL among any wideout with at least 20 catches. Kincaid had 104 more yards of YAC than Dawson Knox did in 2022.\n\nYAC isn\'t the ultimate goal, of course. Cole Beasley in his prime didn\'t get a lot of YAC, but he got such great separation, it far outweighed his modest YAC totals. Still, you\'d like to be at least in the middle of the pack.\n\nThank you for all the questions this week!\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

This vast open-world outlaw adventure has fundamentally altered the way players view realism in games. Players who value exploration and discovery enter the world Rockstar carefully crafted for an immersive and detailed experience where freedom is in the expression of the game's most realistic elements, from touching and horrifying animal behaviors to seemingly lifelike NPCs.\n\nThe majority of player freedom in Red Dead Redemption 2 is crafted not as inherent problems to be solved but as engaging, thoughtful experiences to be observed and reacted to. Whether or not players decide to engage with these details, the gameplay is affected every step of the way.\n\n10 Weapons Are Not as Effective When Not Maintained\n\nChores Connect Players' Actions with the Realistic Evolution of Surroundings\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nRed Dead 2 Lets Gamers Live Out Their Wildest Westworld Fantasies\n\nWhile Westworld isn't coming back, fans can still experience a breathing, living Western world in the form of Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nWeapons in Red Dead Redemption 2 require regular maintenance to function properly. Visually, the guns will build up dirt and rust based on player actions moving through mud and water, which signifies needed player action to remove. If neglected, this will make the game harder, suggesting players must slow down, be observant of their resources, and engage with more of the game's details for the optimal gameplay experience.\n\nThis realistic approach rewards thoughtful gameplay with optimization, and doesn't only apply to weapons but also in doing chores around camp for more positive interactions with NPCs, bonding with the horse to unlock new mechanics, and being mindful of the time and location of player behavior to affect anything from dialogue to honor level, the latter of which has lasting effects throughout the game.\n\n9 NPCs Escape Hogties if Left Unattended for Too Long\n\nDynamic NPC Reactions to Time-Related Player Inaction Create Realism in Gameplay Decisions\n\nPlayers cannot passively take action without considering the consequences in Red Dead Redemption 2. One of the best examples of this is how NPCs will react to player actions such as hog-tying. In many games, combative actions might trigger passive behavior from the NPC, already resulting in a win for the player, but for more realism, the NPCs don't give up so quickly. They fight back in many complex situations, from being hogtied or when bumped into on the street. This necessitates a more strategic approach, making the gameplay more challenging and engaging.\n\nWhile these actions may seem, on the surface, to merely create more work for players and mindless tasks in order to solve ordinarily simple problems (something cheats in RDR2 could help get around), they also add a layer of complexity that can result in new strategic gameplay, such as needing to finish off the rest of a group quickly, or throw the hog-tied enemy on the horse and escape before they can.\n\n8 Precise Shooting Provides Non-Lethal Strategy of Shooting Guns Out of Hands\n\nRealistic NPC Reactions to Player Actions Give Players Strategic Options in Combat\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 has dynamic results associated with where the player shoots an NPC, which can lead to strategic gameplay decisions, such as non-lethal interactions from shooting the gun out of someone's hand instead of killing them. This offers players more choices in how they use their tools, not for efficiency, but for a more human result since players are able to complete some encounters with less violence, which can affect wanted levels and have repercussions throughout the game.\n\nShooting an enemy's hand is not a mechanic commonly found in other games and requires players to aim carefully and consider the consequences of their actions. This mechanic not only adds a layer of strategy but also emphasizes the game's commitment to realism.\n\n7 Corpses Attract Scavengers if Left Out in the Open\n\nRealistic Wildlife Interactions Create an Ever-Changing Environment\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\n15 Secrets You Didn't Know Were Hidden In Red Dead Redemption 2's Map\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2's enormous map contains several secrets, hidden locations, and unforgettable encounters that keep players coming back.\n\nEvery game approaches the results of violence differently, but many opt to brush by what happens to all the corpses left in a player's wake. While some may include features for NPCs to find bodies and alert them to the player's presence, Red Dead Redemption 2 takes it a step further with a realistic approach, allowing wildlife to interact with bodies as well.\n\nIf players leave the results of their violence out in the open, animals may come to scavenge the body, so time is of the essence in skinning and taking animal meat, hiding bodies from NPCs who might be alerted from a much further distance when they say animals swarming and even needing to hide bodies in areas they wouldn't normally consider in other games. While this may seem like an unnecessary feature taking realism a step too far, this detail also allows for unique experiences and player creativity in disposing of the results of their actions, which can force players to examine if their violence is worth the consequences.\n\n6 Construction Progresses in Towns Over Time\n\nEvolving Environments Reflect the Passage of Time\n\nIn many games, players are left wondering why NPCs work so hard, to no avail, but in Red Dead Redemption 2, players who keenly observe their surroundings as time passes in the game, are rewarded. In the towns, there are buildings under construction at the beginning of the game that are completed by the end. One such evolving building is a restaurant in Valentine.\n\nBuildings are not the only things that change as time passes in the game; Arthur's hair grows and can be maintained, cut, and styled by the player, and players can watch railroad tracks being hammered down and progressively added. In fact, the Central Union Railroad construction allows players to perform missions for the group, and throughout the chapters, the camp moves further along the tracks until it disappears, entirely, at the railroad's completion.\n\n5 Frogs Croak in Swamplands\n\nAuthentic Sound Design Immerses Players\n\nMuch work was put into the sound design in Red Dead Redemption 2, which is arguably one of the most immersive features of the game. Players can close their eyes and determine what type of ground they're passing over, if weather patterns are shifting, and where they are geographically, simply by the realistic sounds.\n\nThese aren't simply random auditorily pleasing sounds, from leaves rustling in the wind, rain and thunder creating an oppresive sound fitting of the decreased visibility, flies buzzing around decomposing items, gunshot variations indoors and outdoors, and frogs croaking in a swampland, the realistic sounds make players feel immersed in RDR2's world.\n\n4 Eating Results in Weight Gain and Loss\n\nRealistic Character Changes Give Players Motivation to Manage Health\n\nClose\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 gives players visual cues of realistic progression due to player actions, such as if you feed Arthur too much and aren't keeping him active, he'll gain weight. This mechanic doesn't just affect Arthur visually, gameplay is drastically affected by his food intake.\n\nOpting for this realistic approach to food consumption also influences players to interact more with the environment around them in hunting, fishing, cooking, and donating to the camp's food stores in order to provide an optimal gameplay environment. This feature affects nearly every facet of the game in arguably the most realistic way any video game has ever done.\n\n3 NPCs Feel More Realistic Due to Detailed Routines\n\nNPCs Have Scripted Routines With Just Enough Dynamic Features to Feel Multi-Dimensional\n\nRelated\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2: 5 Side-Quests Every Player Should Complete\n\nRed Dead Redemption II has a big world with many fun distractions, with these being among the most fulfilling and notable among players.\n\nNPCs in Red Dead Redemption 2 have detailed schedules and routines based on loose stories to create what feels like living and breathing characters. These routines provide a foundation for more organic reactions to events in the world, such as weather, along with those caused by the player's decisions.\n\nPlayers can follow NPCs and find them to have specific work schedules as in many other games, but unique to RDR2 is the ability to follow NPCs to lunch and extracurricular activities such as dinner, drinks, and poker at the Saloon. This can result in unique, planned opportunities for the most committed players.\n\n2 NPCs React to Blood and Mud Accumulation on Clothing and Skin\n\nDynamic NPC Reactions to Player Actions Give Seemingly Conversational Experiences With NPCs\n\nArthur's hair isn't the only maintenance players can affect in Red Dead Redemption 2, and one specific feature is much more eventful if players choose to neglect it. If players fall into the mud or get blood on them during a fight, Arthur visually stays dirty, and they'll need to wash him by purchasing a bath at a local hotel or taking a dip in a stream.\n\nIf players choose to ignore this feature, they'll find NPCs won't take kindly to Arthur's health choices and will comment on his disheveled appearance. When pairing these NPC reactions with their routines and memories of players' past actions, the uniquely layered character interactions become multi-dimensional, realistic-seeming conversations.\n\n1 Horses' Muscles Move and Anatomy Changes Realistically in Weather\n\nDetailed Horse Design Creates Bonding Experience for Players\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2: What Do Arthur's Dreams About the Wolf and Deer Mean?\n\nThe symbolic nature of the animals in Arthur's visions speaks profoundly about the nature of Red Dead Redemption II's central theme.\n\nMany players' favorite details to mention are those associated with their horses. Red Dead Redemption 2 requires significant time spent with horses, no matter how players engage with the game, and no details were spared on this important feature.\n\nFrom weather realistically altering the horses' anatomy, to players bonding with their horse by frequent caretaking, to muscle contractions during movements, to dust kicked up behind their hoves, to being upset if players approach without a calm demeanor, to custom naming for each stabled furry friend, the horse is one of the most memorable and detailed experiences players can have in the world of Red Dead Redemption 2, and for many players, won't soon be forgotten.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nPlayed from a first- or third-person perspective, the game is set in an open-world environment featuring a fictionalized version of the United States in 1899.\n\nPlatform(s) PS4 , Xbox One , PC , Stadia\n\nReleased October 26, 2018\n\nDeveloper(s) Rockstar Games\n\nPublisher(s) Rockstar Games\n\nGenre(s) Action , Adventure\n\nMultiplayer Online Multiplayer\n\nEngine RAGE\n\nESRB M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Sexual Content, Strong Language, Use of Drugs and Alcohol\n\nHow Long To Beat 50 Hours\n\nMetascore 97\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nSystem Google , PC , PlayStation , Xbox\n\nExpand", 'source': {'uri': 'cbr.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBR'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/arthur-morgan-horse-and-poker.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 458577810, 'relevance': 7}

An apoplectic Fred Jacoby, the Southwest Conference commissioner, called it "crazy."\n\nWhy, the SEC was already bursting at the seams with 10 teams! Poaching not just Texas but Texas A&M and Arkansas, as reported, would give it enough inventory for two conferences!\n\nTurns out the scoop was 35 years premature, at least in Texas\' case, but, ready or not, here we are at last.\n\nTexas\' first official act as an SEC member -- unless you count pirating the baseball coach in College Station -- will take place when SEC Media Days convene downtown at the Omni with all the humility of Mardi Gras.\n\nSince their transfer was processed three summers ago, Texas and Oklahoma partisans had waited on July 1, the day it became official, like it was the end of Prohibition. They\'ve been fishing kids out of fountains on both campuses ever since.\n\nAnd make no mistake, the buzz is what it\'s all about. Frankly, this is what Jacoby missed back in \'89 and what yours truly failed to see when A&M beat Texas to the punch a dozen years ago. Back then, I figured the Aggies\' prime motivation for going to the SEC was to get out from under the shadow of their biggest rival. That no doubt played a part, but it was superseded by the lure of this:\n\nAn invitation to the biggest show in college football.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nThis is what SEC Media Days -- and their "record" 49 hours of original programming -- are all about. This is what SEC fans are saying when they chant "S-E-C" at the underprivileged. We may only be 7-5, but we were mediocre in the world\'s greatest football conference. We may not have won as much as a division title in the BCS/CFP era, but SEC schools have won 15 national championships since 1998, and that reflects well on all of us. We believe if there\'s such a thing as guilt by association, the opposite must be true, too. That\'s what Sancho Panza tried to tell Don Quixote, anyway.\n\nYou are the company you keep, even if that company beats your brains in every week.\n\nLike A&M did with Johnny Football during its first couple years in the SEC, the Longhorns will do just fine in football, at least initially. Texas doesn\'t need membership in an exclusive club to feel good about itself, either. Once asked about keeping up with the Joneses, Texas\' former athletic director, DeLoss Dodds, famously said, "We are the Joneses." Texas simply got tired of the company it kept. That\'s what killed the SWC. The Big 12 had promise until it first atrophied, then bloated. Even at that, Texas won just four Big 12 football titles, a distant second to Oklahoma\'s 14. Winning only gets harder now, not that it seems to matter.\n\nWill Texas make more money? Sure, but only A&M has rivaled it in football revenue year in and year out. Will the Longhorns recruit better? No doubt, but ultimately NIL and collectives will have more to say about the destination of teenagers than conference affiliations.\n\nMy problem for years was looking at it strictly from a football perspective. If the objective is to make the playoffs, why take the hardest path possible? Didn\'t Texas just go to the semifinals as a Big 12 member? Wouldn\'t it be easier to do it again from the Big 12, especially in an expanded playoff format?\n\nNo one would have called it cheap if Texas had won it all last season, just like no one questions the validity of its national titles from the \'60s while dominating a mostly two-team league.\n\nLike A&M, Arkansas and Missouri before them, Texas will find that football in the SEC is a grind. There will be no more parachuting into Tuscaloosa for a signature win, then stealing out again. Every week is more of the same. That sort of thing wears on you after a while.\n\nOf course, maybe Steve Sarkisian has the Longhorns ready for just such a jump in competition. He knows the SEC as well as anyone and has all the resources necessary to win at a national level. Then again Texas has always had those resources and had its hands full just dealing with Oklahoma. Now the Longhorns will have three or four games a year at least as tough as Texas-OU.\n\nThe crazy thing is, that\'s exactly what they want. The prospects of losing don\'t matter as much to the masses as the entertainment value of worthy opponents who might be proven equals. Selling out all 100,000-plus seats at DKR-Memorial will be a snap. On the road, the locals will have to find space in neighboring airports to accommodate all those private jets from Texas, like they did last year in Tuscaloosa. This is the new norm. The Longhorns finally have a jury of their peers. A verdict awaits on football, but the buzz is back.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'newsadvance.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NewsAdvance.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newsadvance.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/b1/6b193e1e-d274-5659-9056-92602ecb7d7e/66925747ce699.image.jpg?crop=1773%2C931%2C0%2C119&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9730111', 'sentiment': 0.03529411764705892, 'wgt': 458564265, 'relevance': 51}

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- They are in charge of a city\'s future, a chore as inscrutable as it sounds.\n\nDocuments, lawyers and polls, they have. Absolute certainty, they do not. How do you predict the next week, let alone the next decade? Who do you turn to for help? Where, exactly, does one find answers about the future?\n\nStrangely enough, perhaps in the past.\n\nThe St. Pete City Council is scheduled to decide Thursday on a proposed $6.5 billion redevelopment of the Historic Gas Plant District that includes a new baseball stadium for the Rays. It\'s as monumental a decision as any local council has made since ...\n\nThe last time the St. Pete City Council approved a Rays stadium deal.\n\nThe circumstances were different, but the stakes were just as high. Back in 1986, St. Pete was the civic manifestation of an inferiority complex, except with beaches. Local leaders made a seemingly unhinged decision to build a domed stadium despite having neither a team, a viable ownership group, nor a plausible downtown.\n\n"I look at the council today, and their decision seems so much easier than the decision we had because they\'ve already got a team, they\'ve got an owner that\'s going to pay over 50 percent of the stadium costs, and the city\'s share is down around 25 percent," said Bill Bond, who was one of the council members who approved the construction of Tropicana Field by a 6-3 vote in 1986. "I know the current group is agonizing over this, but this deal is far better than what we had to go through.\n\n"All we had was a great belief in the future of St. Petersburg and our gut instincts."\n\nIt took some time, but that belief in the community has been justified. Five years after the opening of the Trop in 1990 -- then known as the Florida Suncoast Dome -- Major League Baseball awarded an expansion franchise to Tampa Bay.\n\nAs a business model, the team has been forever under siege. As a community asset, it has fared far better, even if the stadium was not the only investment the city made around that time. The Bayfront Center and The Pier both underwent renovations, and a tenant was found to reopen the dilapidated Vinoy hotel.\n\nTo what degree the baseball team played in the growth of the city is impossible to say, but it was clearly part of the critical mass that has led to skyscrapers, museums, a thriving nightlife and a real estate boom across the past 30 years.\n\nAnd now the council is again pondering a baseball stadium, along with an ambitious redevelopment plan that would include hotels, housing, office space, an African American museum, an outdoor theater, bike trails, green space and restaurants/bars.\n\n"This is a different scenario than the one we had to deal with," said Bob Stewart, another former council member who voted for the stadium in 1986. "We didn\'t have any guarantee from baseball, but we were headstrong. This time, there\'s a team, a competitive team, already here.\n\n"But there\'s also a lot more at stake, a lot more riding on this vote, that goes far beyond the building of a stadium. I haven\'t sat at the table, I haven\'t looked at all the information, but the significance of this vote is far more complicated than it was back in the 80s."\n\nComplications? You could say that.\n\nThe Rays have been seeking a new stadium for 15 years, looking in Ybor City, on the Tampa Riverwalk, on the St. Pete waterfront and numerous other locations around the bay area.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- They are in charge of a city\'s future, a chore as inscrutable as it sounds.\n\nDocuments, lawyers and polls, they have. Absolute certainty, they do not. How do you predict the next week, let alone the next decade? Who do you turn to for help? Where, exactly, does one find answers about the future?\n\nStrangely enough, perhaps in the past.\n\nThe St. Pete City Council is scheduled to decide Thursday on a proposed $6.5 billion redevelopment of the Historic Gas Plant District that includes a new baseball stadium for the Rays. It\'s as monumental a decision as any local council has made since ...\n\nThe last time the St. Pete City Council approved a Rays stadium deal.\n\nThe circumstances were different, but the stakes were just as high. Back in 1986, St. Pete was the civic manifestation of an inferiority complex, except with beaches. Local leaders made a seemingly unhinged decision to build a domed stadium despite having neither a team, a viable ownership group, nor a plausible downtown.\n\nPeople are also reading...

"I know the current group is agonizing over this, but this deal is far better than what we had to go through.\n\n"All we had was a great belief in the future of St. Petersburg and our gut instincts."\n\nIt took some time, but that belief in the community has been justified. Five years after the opening of the Trop in 1990 -- then known as the Florida Suncoast Dome -- Major League Baseball awarded an expansion franchise to Tampa Bay.\n\nAs a business model, the team has been forever under siege. As a community asset, it has fared far better, even if the stadium was not the only investment the city made around that time. The Bayfront Center and The Pier both underwent renovations, and a tenant was found to reopen the dilapidated Vinoy hotel.\n\nTo what degree the baseball team played in the growth of the city is impossible to say, but it was clearly part of the critical mass that has led to skyscrapers, museums, a thriving nightlife and a real estate boom across the past 30 years.\n\nAnd now the council is again pondering a baseball stadium, along with an ambitious redevelopment plan that would include hotels, housing, office space, an African American museum, an outdoor theater, bike trails, green space and restaurants/bars.\n\n"This is a different scenario than the one we had to deal with," said Bob Stewart, another former council member who voted for the stadium in 1986. "We didn\'t have any guarantee from baseball, but we were headstrong. This time, there\'s a team, a competitive team, already here.\n\n"But there\'s also a lot more at stake, a lot more riding on this vote, that goes far beyond the building of a stadium. I haven\'t sat at the table, I haven\'t looked at all the information, but the significance of this vote is far more complicated than it was back in the 80s."\n\nComplications? You could say that.\n\nThe Rays have been seeking a new stadium for 15 years, looking in Ybor City, on the Tampa Riverwalk, on the St. Pete waterfront and numerous other locations around the bay area. All of their plans have collapsed, usually due to disagreements over the amount of public funds requested for stadium construction.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe plan to reimagine the Tropicana Field site was borne out of desperation -- and also the lure of 86 prime acres and the team\'s current stadium use agreement that gives the Rays a cut of any redevelopment proceeds. The Rays were willing to pay a greater portion of stadium costs than they were in Hillsborough County, because they stood to make a sizable profit on the redevelopment of the surrounding land.\n\nThat led to additional complications, because critics of the deal -- along with several council members -- insist the city is giving away too much in public subsidies along with relinquishing control of the redevelopment plan to the Rays and their partner, Hines. Between the city\'s share ($287.5 million) and Pinellas County\'s portion ($312.5 million) of construction costs, this would be the largest public contribution ever for an MLB stadium.\n\nBut there\'s a caveat.\n\nIt\'s a record-breaking number only because of inflation. In terms of percentage, the city/county contribution is similar or less than other recent MLB stadium projects. With the Rays picking up $700 million (plus overruns) of the anticipated $1.3 billion ballpark, the public\'s share is roughly 46%.\n\nIn Arlington, Texas, where a stadium for the Rangers opened in 2020, the public share was about 42%. In Atlanta (2017) it was 45%, and in both Miami (2012) and Minnesota (2010) it was 75%. The raw numbers in the city/county share of the Gas Plant deal will also be eclipsed by the $625 million the city of Jacksonville just committed to rebuild a football stadium for the NFL\'s Jaguars.\n\nExpensive, yes. Unprecedented, no.\n\nWhile economists seem almost unanimous in their opinion that sports venues are not great economic drivers and usually end up costing municipalities far more than they bring in, the argument in this case is that the Historic Gas Plant makeover is more than just a stadium construction project.\n\nThere was once a thriving community where Tropicana Field sits. Perhaps it was low-income -- a blighted area is how the city designated it in 1978 -- but it was home to generations of Black families with churches, grocery stores and schools of their own. When the land was razed, years before a baseball stadium was proposed, 27 businesses and more than 280 families had to relocate.\n\nThe original stadium was pitched as a boon for nearby residents, although the most tangible benefits seemed weighted more toward downtown.\n\nThis redevelopment plan replaces acres of parking spaces with more attractive community assets, including affordable housing.\n\n"I think we have learned lessons from the last time," said St. Pete Mayor Ken Welch, whose father, David, was on the council in 1986 and voted in favor of the stadium. "These are not just some vague promises (in the redevelopment deal), these are documented agreements, legal agreements and commitments to make sure this development is equitable and does have those inclusive community benefits that are detailed.\n\n"We documented the promise this time, and we\'ve got a partner going into this that really understands and has embraced our approach."\n\nSo, will this ongoing saga reach a conclusion in the coming days?\n\nNot quite. The council still has a workshop to go over revisions that were made in response to questions. Even if the city approves the project -- and votes on ancillary matters have passed with a 5-3 majority in recent weeks -- the county commission must still give the go-ahead for its share of the bill. In other words, sit tight.\n\nIt\'s been 45 years since the old Gas Plant neighborhood was informed of its impending doom.

Frankly, this is what Jacoby missed back in \'89 and what yours truly failed to see when A&M beat Texas to the punch a dozen years ago. Back then, I figured the Aggies\' prime motivation for going to the SEC was to get out from under the shadow of their biggest rival. That no doubt played a part, but it was superseded by the lure of this:\n\nAn invitation to the biggest show in college football.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nThis is what SEC Media Days -- and their "record" 49 hours of original programming -- are all about. This is what SEC fans are saying when they chant "S-E-C" at the underprivileged. We may only be 7-5, but we were mediocre in the world\'s greatest football conference. We may not have won as much as a division title in the BCS/CFP era, but SEC schools have won 15 national championships since 1998, and that reflects well on all of us. We believe if there\'s such a thing as guilt by association, the opposite must be true, too. That\'s what Sancho Panza tried to tell Don Quixote, anyway.\n\nYou are the company you keep, even if that company beats your brains in every week.\n\nLike A&M did with Johnny Football during its first couple years in the SEC, the Longhorns will do just fine in football, at least initially. Texas doesn\'t need membership in an exclusive club to feel good about itself, either. Once asked about keeping up with the Joneses, Texas\' former athletic director, DeLoss Dodds, famously said, "We are the Joneses." Texas simply got tired of the company it kept. That\'s what killed the SWC. The Big 12 had promise until it first atrophied, then bloated. Even at that, Texas won just four Big 12 football titles, a distant second to Oklahoma\'s 14. Winning only gets harder now, not that it seems to matter.\n\nWill Texas make more money? Sure, but only A&M has rivaled it in football revenue year in and year out. Will the Longhorns recruit better? No doubt, but ultimately NIL and collectives will have more to say about the destination of teenagers than conference affiliations.\n\nMy problem for years was looking at it strictly from a football perspective. If the objective is to make the playoffs, why take the hardest path possible? Didn\'t Texas just go to the semifinals as a Big 12 member? Wouldn\'t it be easier to do it again from the Big 12, especially in an expanded playoff format?\n\nNo one would have called it cheap if Texas had won it all last season, just like no one questions the validity of its national titles from the \'60s while dominating a mostly two-team league.\n\nLike A&M, Arkansas and Missouri before them, Texas will find that football in the SEC is a grind. There will be no more parachuting into Tuscaloosa for a signature win, then stealing out again. Every week is more of the same. That sort of thing wears on you after a while.\n\nOf course, maybe Steve Sarkisian has the Longhorns ready for just such a jump in competition. He knows the SEC as well as anyone and has all the resources necessary to win at a national level. Then again Texas has always had those resources and had its hands full just dealing with Oklahoma. Now the Longhorns will have three or four games a year at least as tough as Texas-OU.\n\nThe crazy thing is, that\'s exactly what they want. The prospects of losing don\'t matter as much to the masses as the entertainment value of worthy opponents who might be proven equals. Selling out all 100,000-plus seats at DKR-Memorial will be a snap. On the road, the locals will have to find space in neighboring airports to accommodate all those private jets from Texas, like they did last year in Tuscaloosa. This is the new norm. The Longhorns finally have a jury of their peers. A verdict awaits on football, but the buzz is back.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'heraldcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HeraldCourier.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/f6/ff6b3611-68cc-52ef-b6bd-29ad93da4395/66925619240ce.image.jpg?crop=1773%2C931%2C0%2C119&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9730111', 'sentiment': 0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 458562812, 'relevance': 51}

As coastal risks mount, with climate change raising waters and intensifying storms, the shoreline mapping helps scientists detect the most vulnerable areas.\n\nIn other words: "Where are the beaches that need the most help to prevent the worst impacts of storms?" said Larry Ward, one of the principal investigators of the University of New Hampshire\'s Volunteer Beach Profile Monitoring Program.\n\nThirty-nine regular volunteers and five substitutes, who fill in periodically, help answer that question and others, performing beach profiles at 15 stations on a mostly monthly basis. Those volunteers, ranging from high schoolers to retirees, undergo "a very stringent training program" with UNH scientists, Ward said.\n\nThe scientists - professionals and volunteers - have together mapped stories of recovery with data. and their findings have reinforced the fact that just as each beach is different, so is its comeback from a storm.\n\nAfter three storms in a two-week period in March 2018, New Hampshire\'s coastal beaches were devastated, Ward said. Some beaches have lower elevations than others, "so, when a storm does come, those low-lying beaches get hit harder," he said.\n\nHampton Beach was "heavily eroded," Ward said, "but bounced back relatively fast." Meanwhile, he said, "North Beach and North Hampton Beach still have changed from it." They have low elevations that haven\'t fully rebounded since that series of hits more than six years ago. Wallis Sands Beach in Rye lies somewhere in between in terms of recovery.\n\nDetailed reports\n\nThose findings and others have been detailed in reports emanating from the program. and they come from a citizen approach to science. Alyson Eberhardt, the other principal investigator of the program, focuses on the volunteer aspect of it, her colleague said.\n\n"We couldn\'t possibly do this study without a large set of volunteers helping us," Ward said.\n\nVolunteers aren\'t just collecting data; they\'re also going back home and talking about their work with the people around them. That engagement cultivates "a partnership between the scientists and the managers and the people that live (on) and use the beach," Ward said.\n\nVolunteers typically have "ownership" over a beach, meaning they are returning to collect data at the same station month after month, Ward said, typically working in a group of three.\n\nNew volunteers are trained by UNH scientists, who accompany them on two to three profiling trips to teach them proper field procedures, how to run the profiles, and how to record the information, Ward said.\n\nThen the newcomers pair up with an experienced group. Some volunteers have been part of the program for years and are as adept at the data collection as the scientists who manage the program, Ward said.\n\nNew volunteers\n\nEventually, those new volunteers are woven into the existing group or placed where there is an opening. The UNH scientists visit the stations periodically to work with the volunteers and refresh their skills.\n\nThey extensively prepare the volunteers, but "we give them a lot of independence once they are trained," Ward said. "Ninety-nine percent of the time everything looks great," he said, but if the numbers don\'t look quite right, they\'ll reach out to the volunteers and figure out the issue.\n\nCitizen scientists look a little different than others hitting the beach, armed with clipboards and calibrated rods. and sometimes they have to ask a fellow beachgoer to move for a moment so they can measure the plot of sand they\'re sunbathing on.\n\nThough they time their summer profiling sessions to avoid the crowds, their presence on beaches often elicits curiosity, Ward said, another source of public engagement with the science.\n\nThe volunteers are typically given a three- or four-day window to go out each month, with the process taking about an hour, Ward said. In the cold months, when they time their profiles to midday to avoid the worst temperatures, it can take slightly longer because the volunteers are sometimes taking their gloves on and off.\n\nThe volunteers will brave snow and ice to make measurements, but plovers - an endangered species of bird - have kept the profilers from one or two stations recently, Ward said. Still, monthly changes are mostly documented.\n\nFinding the markers\n\nWhen volunteers get to their beach, they head out to the station marker, designated with a painted spot on the seawall or a stake in the ground.\n\nThen, the groups use what\'s called the Emery method to profile the beach, using the two sticks of identical length to record elevation, starting from the marker and moving down the beach.\n\nThey also snap pictures so the UNH scientists can see the condition of the beach, which helps verify that the measurements make sense with how the beach looks.\n\nFinally, the data and photos are uploaded to a Google Drive, and the scientists look at how sand volume and elevation have changed over time and visualize that data into charts and graphs.\n\nThe program recently had $32,000 in federal grants, routed through the Department of Environmental Services, approved by the Executive Council. UNH will provide $20,000 of matching funds, according to a letter describing the program to the council from DES Commissioner Robert R. Scott.\n\nThe program is looking at additional funding sources to continue the work into the future, Ward said.\n\n"Sometimes, it\'s fun," he said of the program, though joking it was not quite as much on one winter holiday where he was profiling a bitterly cold beach. "Sometimes, it\'s beautiful."\n\nNew Hampshire Bulletin is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.', 'source': {'uri': 'eagletribune.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Eagle-Tribune'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'new_hampshire_bulletin@eagletribune.com', 'name': 'New Hampshire Bulletin', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'claire_sullivan@eagletribune.com', 'name': 'Claire Sullivan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/36/f36e5eaa-3ec9-11ef-8919-8f5e1f8ad7f4/668e9d99da222.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.05098039215686279, 'wgt': 458557929, 'relevance': 26}

Immediately ahead of us in the procession was a unit of troopers, two riders accompanied by several attendants, all attired in splendid blue cavalry uniforms.\n\nFor as long as we marched, this little band of cavalry maintained perfect order and discipline. But when we reached the end of the route, some accident or error caused one of the horses to bolt and gallop through the parade route for many blocks, slightly injuring a bystander and bringing the march to a halt until order was restored.\n\nLocal media in the D.C. area reported on the runaway horse. No coverage that I have seen, however, not even in the flagship Washington Post, reported on who exactly had brought the horses to the parade or bothered trying to explain what went wrong.\n\nSometimes a horse is more than a horse. Although this episode could have produced serious injury both to the horse and to humans, it may seem rather insignificant in the scheme of things. But it is, in fact, worth thinking about if we want to understand why many of us are deeply concerned for the future of our country and its media.\n\nAccording to the official program, the troopers and their horses came from Troop A of the Maryland Defense Force Cavalry. What I learned about this in the few minutes it took to do a Google search was apparently not of interest to the host of supposed professional journalists who took the time to put out stories on this mishap.\n\nUnderstand that the Maryland state military was not in the parade just for fun. The troopers were there with their war horses to show off their power and discipline. They marched to demonstrate that danger and to show that their force, like the precision and power of more famous ceremonial units like the U.S. Navy\'s Blue Angels, was at the service of our government to be employed for the defense of the country against enemies foreign and domestic.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a few seconds of inattention or some other unspecified accident they failed to control, the Maryland Cavalry displayed the danger more vividly than their discipline. Instead of scaring our enemies, the bolting horse rightly scared us.\n\nWe Marylanders don\'t know what went wrong, and if we rely on our establishment media, we may never find out who or what was responsible for what went wrong.\n\nThe United States rose to paramount power not only because of its continental situation, the attendant population and the resources at its command, but also because our free and uncontrolled press has always been quick to report when something in the raising, training, equipping, or deployment of our military seemed poorly planned or executed, reveling in the opportunity to embarrass the military brass or its civilian overseers. Do they still?\n\nIf our military malfunctions on parade, we should be concerned about what worse, even potentially devastating malfunctions will happen when our enemies get a vote on what happens. It is the job of our media, which nobody else can do with the same potential freedom from the influence of party or personal interests, to voice those fears and concerns and help ensure that those we elect adequately address them.\n\nTo paraphrase former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, we go to war with the media we have, not the media we want. The media we have defines "professionalism" as sharing and enforcing the opinions prevalent among their colleagues and parroting what progressives in power tell them rather than enforcing the old standards and tools of professional journalism.\n\nToo many in our media choose to help those in power police voters from voting "wrong" instead of being the first to ask "who, what, when, where, and how" when something goes wrong.\n\nThis leaves us blind to the dangers our enemies pose as well as the dangers of the inadequately controlled, trained, and equipped forces we have in place to confront our enemies if that should be required. It is not just the White House press corps that has seemingly forgotten how to afflict the powerful in order to comfort the afflicted; it\'s all of our mainstream press. Whether the disaster is minor or serious, the press should be there to make sure lessons will be learned and the sufferings occasioned by a disaster will not be proved vain.', 'source': {'uri': 'amgreatness.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'American Greatness'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'michael_s_kochin@amgreatness.com', 'name': 'Michael S.

After fleeing war and persecution at home, 36 athletes from 11 countries will compete in the Paris Games as part of the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nThe team was created for the Rio Olympics in 2016 as a symbol of hope and to call attention to the plight of refugees worldwide.\n\nIn Paris, the refugee athletes will take the stage at a time of record global migration, with hundreds of millions of people -- many of them displaced from their homes -- working to reinvent themselves just as these athletes have.\n\nThe record migration comes alongside a rise in far-right populism across much of the world, with officials and parties in many countries promising to clamp down on immigration and asylum.\n\nAt the Games, athletes will compete in a host country where the anti-immigration far-right party saw a surge of voter support in parliamentary elections, but was beaten back by a coalition of the French left and failed to win a majority.\n\nThe refugee athletes will compete in 12 sports, but for many, their journey to Paris is already a victory in itself.\n\nFernando Dayán Jorge, Cuban, canoeing\n\nFernando Dayán Jorge spent his childhood flying past rickety fishing boats and colonial houses in the bay next to his home in Cienfuegos, Cuba.\n\nSince he began practicing there with his father when he was 11, he said it feels as if he has lived a thousand lifetimes.\n\nThe 25-year-old canoeist was a two-time Olympian for Cuba\'s national team in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Then, a gold medalist. A deserter of the Cuban team. A migrant. A maintenance worker. And a refugee.\n\nNow, he continues to rocket along on his narrow red-and-white canoe, this time flying past suburban homes in the canals winding through Cape Coral, Fla.\n\nKneeling on his boat, his oar slices through the air as his coach chants "very good work, very good work" from a boat next to him.\n\nJorge\'s eyes are fixed ahead, throwing all his force into his third Olympics.\n\n"After having written off the 2024 Paris Olympics, it\'s a massive opportunity," he said. "There are so many Cubans that come to this country and lose this dream of competing once again, simply because they don\'t know how to get back to this place."\n\nJorge was at the top of his career, having won gold in Tokyo for the 1,000-meter canoe sprint, when he took a daunting step in March 2021. While training in Mexico, Jorge defected, joining a growing number of Cuban athletes in deserting their country amid an ongoing migratory flight.\n\nSome hope to make more money than they can in the communist-run island. Others, like Jorge, say they left because of political differences about how the government treats citizens and athletes.\n\nHe left behind his home and crossed into the United States via the Rio Grande, in hopes of a better -- if uncertain -- life.\n\nArriving to Florida was, in some ways, like starting from scratch. Granted refugee status in the U.S., Jorge said he would wake up hours before sunrise to train, then work eight hours in a maintenance gig to pay his bills.\n\nHe said he watched friends forced to give up everything after migrating, but he fought to continue as a professional athlete.\n\n"I had a hard time getting out of bed every day and keeping my head on straight," he said. "I had no support whatsoever."\n\nBecoming one of the first Cubans to compete on the Refugee Olympic Team changed everything for him, he said. Still, he is among those who\'ve struggled to cover the costs of competing internationally. He opened a GoFundMe page in June to help pay his way to the Games.\n\nCuba has protested the inclusion of Jorge and Cuban weightlifter Ramiro Mora on the team, saying they should not be considered refugees.\n\nToday, Jorge\'s life in Cuba and his future in Florida seem to blend together in his home. His red, blue and white Cuba jersey sits framed over his doorway, while medals from competitions in the U.S. hang over a statue of the Olympic emblem.\n\n"To the refugees and athletes who\'ve been through the same thing, I want to tell them to not give up," he said. "No matter how dark the days become, the sun is always going to rise."\n\nManizha Talash, Afghan, breaking\n\nManizha Talash does not fear the Taliban.\n\n"I\'m here because I want to reach my dream. Not because I\'m scared," she declared from Spain, where she was granted asylum.\n\nOn the outskirts of Madrid, the 21-year-old is training hard for the Games, which for the first time will include breaking, or, as it\'s popularly known, breakdancing. Talash prances and swivels on her hands and feet to the beat of hip-hop, swooshing her black and red hair around before striking a pose signaling the end of her performance.\n\nJust months ago, she was working in a hair salon in the town of Huesca. Talash was among hundreds of Afghans brought to Spain aboard military planes following the return of the Taliban to power in August 2021.\n\nTalash first came across breaking at age 17. She saw a social media video of a man spinning on his head and was skeptical -- it must have been fake, generated by AI, she thought. But the images were real, and she said she soon became obsessed with the sport, scrolling through video after video on her phone.\n\n"I wanted to do it, I wanted to learn it," she said.\n\nShe found a club in Kabul where a dancer from the videos trained and knocked at the door. "There were 55 boys, and I was the only girl," she said. "I told myself, why can\'t a girl do this?"\n\nBreaking in some ways freed her from the problems facing young women in Afghanistan. But it wasn\'t long before Talash was noticed -- international news outlets published stories about the young Afghan woman defying cultural and religious norms. That was enough to become a target.\n\n"The Taliban don\'t like it when a girl dances," she said, even though breaking is more than that -- it\'s a sport.\n\nHer club began receiving threats, Talash said, and one day, when a bomb hit very close, local police asked them to shut down over the dangers.\n\nShe trained behind closed doors in her home until the Taliban\'s return to power. Despite initial promises women\'s rights wouldn\'t be curtailed, women have since been barred from studying and face several restrictions on employment, travel and health.\n\n"Now, girls can\'t do anything," Talash said.\n\nShe\'s had little time to train while adapting to a foreign country, and at some points, competing in the Games seemed unfathomable.\n\n"But when my friend told me I could join the refugee team, I was so happy," Talash said. "I can now fly."\n\nMohammad Amin Alsalami, Syrian, athletics\n\nWhen Mohammad Amin Alsalami arrived in Berlin in October 2015, he was cold, lonely and homesick.\n\nThe Syrian refugee had left behind his war-torn hometown of Aleppo, fled to Turkey, crossed the Mediterranean on a rubber boat to Greece, and trekked by foot to Germany. Like millions of other migrants, he was in search of a place where he could build a future without bombs and violence.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Alsalami, 29, has been granted asylum, learned German and made new friends. And he\'s living his dream of becoming a world-class athlete.\n\nHe learned just months ago he got the green light to participate in the Paris Games.\n\n"That moment was so wow," he said. "I get to go to the Olympics. I cried so much. It was really cool."\n\nAlsalami discovered his passion for athletics during physical education in school at age 15. A teacher noticed his talent for long jump and pushed him to participate in local and national competitions in Syria. But when civil war erupted, he could no longer practice. His family -- he\'s the youngest of nine siblings and comes from a family of tailors -- was displaced several times within Syria, then fled to Turkey. Alsalami decided to continue on to Europe on his own.\n\nHe credits his passion for athletics with getting him through the initial hardships in his new country.\n\nDuring the first weeks in Berlin, he looked up different stadiums and gyms on Google maps so he could start practicing long jump again. He remembers walking through the first snow to finally discover one of the city\'s big indoor gymnasiums.\n\n"All the other Berlin track and field athletes were training in this hall," he said. "When I came in and saw how full and how warm it was inside ... it was almost like paradise for me."\n\nOn that first day, a man watched him jump, approached him and asked something in German.\n\n"I didn\'t understand anything, not in English either," Alsalami said. "And then I said \'Hey, I\'m Syrian\' on my cellphone, and he said \'I\'m your trainer from now on.\'"\n\nHe stayed with that first coach for five years, then moved on to a different one -- and said he\'s eternally grateful to both for their support.\n\nDespite his excitement for the Games, Alsalami admits he\'s a bit sad that he can\'t represent his home country.\n\n"Syria is home, I miss it every day," he said. "In the end, that\'s my country, that\'s where I come from."\n\nIman Mahdavi, Iranian, wrestling\n\nIman Mahdavi smiles and dishes up Iranian food he has cooked himself at his Milan home.\n\n"If my mum could see me now," he said with a laugh. "She wouldn\'t believe it."\n\nMahdavi hasn\'t seen his mother since October 2020, when the Iranian wrestler fled his home country fearing for his life.\n\nWith only the clothes he was wearing, Mahdavi made a harrowing journey by foot from Iran to Turkey, then flew to Italy and applied for asylum.\n\n"I didn\'t even really know where I was flying to," said Mahdavi, 29. "Luckily for me, it was Italy."\n\nOnce he was granted asylum, one of Mahdavi\'s first aims was to continue wrestling. His father, once a wrestler himself, had instilled in his son a passion. Mahdavi became a seven-time national junior champion and won more than 50 medals.\n\nThrough a friend he connected with on Instagram, Mahdavi was introduced to a gym on the outskirts of Milan.\n\n"As soon as we had him in the gym, in his first training sessions, we immediately saw that he was an extraordinary athlete, that he was a very, very high-level wrestler," said Giuseppe Gammarota, president of Lotta Club Seggiano. "We immediately started preparing him for competitions."\n\nThe gym has become like family to him -- so much so that he calls his coach, Marco Moroni, "Papi."\n\nMahdavi said his real father died of a heart attack several years ago after being mistakenly told his son died in a car crash.\n\nIt was Moroni who helped Mahdavi find a job, as a nightclub bouncer.\n\nMahdavi admits the schedule can be tough: He works from 11 p.m.-5 a.m., goes home to sleep, then trains every day. But he has a focus that drives him.\n\n"The Olympics is a dream for any athlete who does any sport," he said. "I hope to come back from the Olympics with the best colored medal I can get. And I will also be thinking about the next Olympics, hoping I\'m still in form."', 'source': {'uri': 'newstribune.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Jefferson City News Tribune'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/sites/newstribune/img/branding/story-placeholder.png', 'eventUri': 'eng-9725114', 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 458547166, 'relevance': 26}

The search term "hotels in Berlin" has seen an incredible 777 per cent rise since they defeated Netherlands in the semi-final.\n\nHow has the hospitality industry in Berlin reacted to the surge?\n\nWhile some England fans won\'t see money as any object in the way of seeing their team play, many will miss out on the chance.\n\nAirlines and hotels have reacted quickly, seeing prices soaring after England\'s win.\n\n"After the incredible win last night I decided to take a look at hotels in Berlin, with the hypothetical idea that me and my mates might fly to Berlin on Sunday for the match. I found a hotel that was just over £100 when the game had ended, but when I looked again this morning it\'s nearly 10 times more expensive," one fan, Nick, told Travel Republic.\n\nNick\'s experience is not unusual. Many potential customers have seen the immediate impact on supply and demand affecting airline and hotel pricing ahead of the final.\n\nEven if they\'ll have nowhere to stay - at least nowhere cheap - some fans have been able to get tickets to the final.\n\nThey\'re the lucky ones, though, as there\'s also been a 1,262 per cent increase in searches for "Euros final tickets" since Wednesday.\n\nAny remaining tickets for England\'s unprecedented appearance in the final on Sunday cost between €95 and €2,025 - but they\'re likely to be snapped up extremely quickly.\n\nThe final is set to take place at Berlin\'s Olympiastadion - the largest host of any of the Euros matches this time around.\n\nHome to just short of 75,000 seats, those fans who can\'t secure a precious spot will likely stay in Berlin and cheer on players from fan zones as well as the many pubs and bars of the capital.\n\nHas Germany seen an increase in tourism since the beginning of the Euros?\n\nEnglish football fans have already made history with more than 300,000 of them travelling to Germany to watch the tournament unfold over the course of the 2024 Euros.\n\nThat\'s the highest attendance of England fans since the 2016 Euros hosted in France.\n\nTaking part in ten cities across Germany, including Berlin, interest in the nation has been significant.\n\nOnline travel agent Opodo says, since kickoff on 14 June, there\'s been a 39 per cent increase in bookings for travel to Germany between then and 14 July - compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nUK-based football fans have made up 17 per cent of the total bookings among fans travelling to the cities where the matches are taking place.\n\nDuring the first three England matches, which took place from 14 June to 26 June, 38 per cent of all Opodo bookings came from the UK, with most staying between 2 and 4 days to see their team triumph on the pitch.', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.news.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/euronews_uk_articles_973/e5e20d60f7927ab817f8c12b2a318daa', 'eventUri': 'eng-9724220', 'sentiment': 0.08235294117647052, 'wgt': 458543810, 'relevance': 78}

Bynum said Friday.\n\nC.L. Daniel, a Georgia native whose name had never before come to the attention of race massacre researchers, is the first person identified through a project launched five years ago by Bynum to find unmarked burials from the May 31-June 1 calamity in which more than 35 square blocks of Tulsa\'s Black Greenwood District were destroyed by whites and dozens and perhaps hundreds of people were killed.\n\nDNA comparisons, genealogical research and two letters in the National Archives led Intermountain Forensics, a firm working with the city, to Daniel. The DNA and genealogy narrowed the search to two brothers with that last name.\n\nOne of the letters, a 1936 missive from a Georgia attorney to the U.S. Veterans Administration on behalf of Daniel\'s mother, identified Daniel as almost certainly the occupant of what archeologists denote as Burial #3 in the old Black paupers\' section of Oaklawn.\n\nThe letter, from Stanford Arnold of Newnan, Georgia, on behalf of Amanda Daniel, seeks "any benefits that be due her" because of her son\'s service and honorable discharge because of injury.\n\n"She has no discharge (papers) and is going to have difficulty in establishing his death," Arnold wrote. "C.L. was killed in a race riot in Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921 according to best information she has furnished me."\n\nIt is unclear whether the VA responded or if Amanda Daniel, whom the lawyer described as "in destitute circumstances," received any assistance.\n\nThe National Archives search also produced a letter written by C.L. Daniel, apparently to the Army, in February 1921 from Ogden, Utah. In poignant language, Daniel said his legs pained him, apparently from an injury suffered in the Army, and made finding work difficult. Daniel says he spent 19 days in the Camp Gordon, Georgia, hospital.\n\n"(F)or some time I have traveled this country over and now sufriend (suffering) with complance (complaints) that (I) was in the base hospitle (hospital) with," Daniel wrote, his spelling and grammar a testament to the sort of education many Americans and especially Black Americans received in the early 20th century. "(D)ear sir, please send me a nof (enough) money to git me a job and to eat with till I Get better."\n\nDaniel\'s burial place was among the first uncovered in 2020 by the team headed by state archeologist Kary Stackelbeck and University of Florida forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield. Its proximity to the headstones of two known massacre victims, Reuben Everett and Eddie Lockard, and to an area in which other remains were similarly buried, make the researchers reasonably certain they have found the "original 18" -- 18 Black massacre victims reported at the time to have been buried in Oaklawn Cemetery but without information about their exact location -- and two sets of remains with signs of gunshot wounds.\n\nStubblefield said a cause of death could not be determined for Daniel, whose remains were exhumed in 2021 and later reinterred in the same grave. She said it appeared that the body had been scrunched into a coffin too small for him.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBynum indicated that Daniel\'s family, whose members were not identified, have not decided how they want to proceed with final burial.\n\n"We\'re going to work with them every step of the way," Bynum said. "Whatever they decide to do with the remains, the city of Tulsa is fully supportive of that."\n\nDaniel\'s identification accounts for one of several of the Original 18 listed on death certificates as "unknown." It also has reinvigorated the project.\n\nAt Friday\'s press conference, Bynum said the archeological team will return to Oaklawn on July 22. Stackelbeck indicated that this phase will last more than a week and will concentrate on the Original 18 area.\n\n"We now feel doubly confident of the criteria we\'ve been using to know which ones are good candidates for exhumation," she said.\n\nDanny Hellwig, director of Intermountain\'s Laboratory Development, said Daniel\'s identification is really the first of its kind.\n\n"This hasn\'t really been done before," Hellwig said. "We\'ve been learning through the process. As we\'ve learned and adapted, we\'re getting better at it. ... We hope this will provide some confidence and context and maybe a lot more trust so that we can expand on this."\n\nIdentification relies on voluntarily submitted DNA, public databases and families\' willingness to answer questions about relatives or ancestors.\n\nIn Daniel\'s case, researchers said, extended family members were mostly unaware of the circumstances of his death, if they knew of him at all. Intermountain\'s Alison Wilde, who handles the genealogical side, said many living family members did not know each other, much less the story of a great uncle who died without direct descendants more than a century ago.\n\nThe Tulsa World is where your story lives\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921\n\nIn 1921, white mobs invaded Greenwood and burned it down\n\nA growing but divided city had tensions rising.

The Greenwood Massacre of 1921 has been largely ignored by history, but Pelley finds a Tulsa community seeking to shed more light on what\'s been called the worst race massacre in history," a preview reads for a "60 Minutes" story airing 6 p.m. Sunday on CBS.\n\nContext for viewers: Six airplanes circled the Greenwood area during the morning hours of June 1.\n\nWhat they were doing, and why there were so many, has long been a matter of passionate debate. Many people believe they were used to shoot at people on the ground and bomb Greenwood.\n\nOfficials said the small craft, generally thought to be two-seat, single-engine Curtis "Jenny" biplanes, were merely keeping track of activities on the ground and relaying the information through written messages dropped in weighted metal cylinders attached to streamers.\n\nTo what extent this explanation was initially challenged is unclear, but in October 1921 the Chicago Defender published a story in which it said Greenwood had been bombed under orders of "prominent city officials."\n\nThe story cited a Van B. Hurley, who the newspaper said had given a signed statement to Elisha Scott, a Kansas attorney.\n\nScott filed dozens of lawsuits on behalf of victims but doesn\'t seem to have ever entered the Hurley affidavit into the record. There is no record of a Van B. Hurley living in Tulsa around the time of the massacre or that anyone by that name ever belonged to the Tulsa police force.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean the story did not have substance. Many people believed city officials were behind the burning of Greenwood, and the explanation that the squadron of planes was only used for surveillance struck some as suspiciously thin.\n\nCertainly the planes had a great psychological impact on many. For example, Mary Jones Parrish wrote about them in her account, as did prominent attorney B.C. Franklin in his.\n\nThe Defender story said the planes dropped "nitroglycerin on buildings, setting them afire."\n\nBut nitroglycerin is an explosive, not an incendiary. It is also highly unstable and dangerous.\n\nThat has caused some to speculate that something like Molotov cocktails might have been used, or "turpentine balls" -- rags soaked in flammable liquid and wrapped around the head of a stick.\n\nThere are several practical reasons why trying to light and throw incendiary devices from an open cockpit airplane of that era would seem a difficult, dangerous and even foolish idea.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean it wasn\'t done.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre / The Tulsa World Library: See all of the coverage of the race massacre in this special report.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921', 'source': {'uri': 'magicvalley.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Magic Valley'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magicvalley.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/5f/95ff6bfc-f359-5d8e-a86c-f5aab1e5b911/66919e3a65bb1.preview.jpg?crop=1764%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2313725490196078, 'wgt': 458542980, 'relevance': 31}

One of them was Kansas State, which he said reached out and offered a very large sum of money to either quarterback Brayden Fowler-Nicolosi or wide receiver Tory Horton (it was unclear to whom he was referring) in exchange for them transferring to the Wildcats.\n\n"If you have enough evidence you can prove it," Norvell said. "But, you know, a smoking gun is a smoking gun. He said a guy from Kansas State called and offered him $600,000 because they lost their quarterback, offered him $600,000 if he entered the portal. I\'m not accusing Kansas State of anything. I\'m just telling you what the kid told me. If they don\'t want their name thrown in it, they should probably get a handle on their people."\n\nK-State made news in Las Vegas even after Chris Klieman and five football players left Big 12 Media Days inside Allegiant Stadium on Monday. Go figure.\n\nNorvell went on to say that Texas A&M and Mississippi also tried entice those players to leave with similar offers.\n\nThis type of thing likely happens all the time, given the current age of college sports. It is technically against NCAA rules for a coaching staff to recruit a football player from another team\'s roster unless his name appears in the transfer portal. But it goes without saying that teams use third parties to reach out to players and express interest.\n\nMost of those conversations are kept private.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nQuestion is: Did the Wildcats really bend the rules to reach out with a lucrative offer for a Colorado State football player?\n\nBased on the context of his statement, it seems like Norvell is most likely referring to Fowler-Nicolosi, who threw for 3,460 yards and 22 touchdowns last season. If that was the case, it wouldn\'t make a ton of sense for the Wildcats to offer him $600,000 because sophomore Avery Johnson is locked in as the team\'s starting quarterback.\n\nWill Howard transferring to Ohio State left a hole on the K-State depth chart at QB, but only at the No. 2 spot. Would the Wildcats really be willing to spend an exorbitant amount on a backup?\n\nK-State ended up landing Connecticut transfer Ta\'Quan Roberson on what is believed to be a much lower NIL deal. He is now expected to serve as QB2 this season.\n\nThe dollar figure that Norvell referred to would make more sense for a star receiver like Horton, who had 1,136 yards and eight touchdowns on 96 catches last season. But a deal of that magnitude would also raise eyebrows because of how confident Klieman seems in the receivers he has returning.\n\nKlieman said earlier this week that he expects big things from Jayce Brown, Keagan Johnson and several others. So much so, that he wants to throw the ball more this season.\n\nThen again, NIL arrangements keep getting higher and higher. It\'s possible that either of these Colorado State players could command $600,000 from Big 12 or SEC teams on the open market.\n\nIt\'s impossible to know what really transpired here. But Norvell wasn\'t afraid to point his finger at a few programs.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'newsadvance.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NewsAdvance.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newsadvance.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/75/37598aef-f5b1-5bf8-b56a-da95d1b43bb2/6691dfc42b2e6.image.jpg?crop=1714%2C900%2C0%2C154&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9726297', 'sentiment': -0.1215686274509804, 'wgt': 458534394, 'relevance': 51}

One of them was Kansas State, which he said reached out and offered a very large sum of money to either quarterback Brayden Fowler-Nicolosi or wide receiver Tory Horton (it was unclear to whom he was referring) in exchange for them transferring to the Wildcats.\n\n"If you have enough evidence you can prove it," Norvell said. "But, you know, a smoking gun is a smoking gun. He said a guy from Kansas State called and offered him $600,000 because they lost their quarterback, offered him $600,000 if he entered the portal. I\'m not accusing Kansas State of anything. I\'m just telling you what the kid told me.

Go figure.\n\nNorvell went on to say that Texas A&M and Mississippi also tried entice those players to leave with similar offers.\n\nThis type of thing likely happens all the time, given the current age of college sports. It is technically against NCAA rules for a coaching staff to recruit a football player from another team\'s roster unless his name appears in the transfer portal. But it goes without saying that teams use third parties to reach out to players and express interest.\n\nMost of those conversations are kept private.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nQuestion is: Did the Wildcats really bend the rules to reach out with a lucrative offer for a Colorado State football player?\n\nBased on the context of his statement, it seems like Norvell is most likely referring to Fowler-Nicolosi, who threw for 3,460 yards and 22 touchdowns last season. If that was the case, it wouldn\'t make a ton of sense for the Wildcats to offer him $600,000 because sophomore Avery Johnson is locked in as the team\'s starting quarterback.\n\nWill Howard transferring to Ohio State left a hole on the K-State depth chart at QB, but only at the No. 2 spot. Would the Wildcats really be willing to spend an exorbitant amount on a backup?\n\nK-State ended up landing Connecticut transfer Ta\'Quan Roberson on what is believed to be a much lower NIL deal. He is now expected to serve as QB2 this season.\n\nThe dollar figure that Norvell referred to would make more sense for a star receiver like Horton, who had 1,136 yards and eight touchdowns on 96 catches last season. But a deal of that magnitude would also raise eyebrows because of how confident Klieman seems in the receivers he has returning.\n\nKlieman said earlier this week that he expects big things from Jayce Brown, Keagan Johnson and several others. So much so, that he wants to throw the ball more this season.\n\nThen again, NIL arrangements keep getting higher and higher. It\'s possible that either of these Colorado State players could command $600,000 from Big 12 or SEC teams on the open market.\n\nIt\'s impossible to know what really transpired here. But Norvell wasn\'t afraid to point his finger at a few programs.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'heraldcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HeraldCourier.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/18/318351ef-94b3-5ad1-a349-37215568d641/6691dfe265f3f.image.jpg?crop=1714%2C900%2C0%2C154&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9726297', 'sentiment': -0.03529411764705881, 'wgt': 458532569, 'relevance': 26}

Waymo, which was formerly Google\'s self-driving car project, is now a subsidiary of the tech giant\'s parent company, Alphabet.\n\nThe incidents, which each allotted damages exceeding $400, took place in the city\'s Tenderloin between June 24 and 26, according to the DA\'s office. Each instance was caught on cameras installed in the vehicles, the authorities said.\n\nProsecutors also alleged that Burton slashed the tires of a three-car Waymo caravan. Court records indicate Burton has been assigned a public defender. Burton\'s attorney, Deputy Public Defender Adam Birka-White, said in a statement that she chosen to plead not guilty.\n\n"Ms. Burton is someone in need of help and not jail, which is why our social workers are actively working to identify and secure appropriate services," Birka-White said. "The District Attorney continues to prioritize punishing poor people at the behest of corporations."\n\nWaymo said in a statement that it is "taking steps to recover the damages sustained, and mitigate the potential for future events."\n\n"Waymo exists to make roads safer, and with that in mind we will always prioritize the safety of our riders and community," it added.\n\nThe arrest follows other reported incidents of vandalism against Waymo\'s self-driving cars in the last year. In February, a Waymo robotaxi was set on fire while driving through the city\'s Chinatown during Lunar New Year celebrations.\n\nAlthough Mayor London Breed at the time had described the vandalism as "an isolated incident," Reuters reported that a passenger in a Waymo the day after the incident had fireworks shot at him.\n\nSan Francisco is one of the main test beds for self-driving tech, and incidents involving the vehicles -- as well as traditional human-driven cars -- are bound to come up. In addition to Waymo, Tesla tested its Full Self-Driving feature in the city earlier this year, and Amazon-owned Zoox took to the winding streets for the first time back in 2018.\n\nCruise, which is owned by General Motors, began operating driverless vehicles in the city in 2022 before suspending testing operations the following year following a collision with a pedestrian who was dragged beneath the vehicle. The company has begun operating again with human drivers behind the wheel, though it said its goal is to eventually resume driverless rides.\n\nSome riders have marveled at Waymo\'s robotaxis -- Business Insider\'s Lloyd Lee recently took a ride in one and wrote that the self-driving vehicle felt like a better driver than some human drivers in San Francisco.\n\nHowever, the vandalism incidents and high level of scrutiny around the cars\' safety over the last year demonstrate the challenges the companies behind the futuristic vehicles face -- even in a techie city like San Francisco.', 'source': {'uri': 'businessinsider.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider India'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'jaures_yip@businessinsider.in', 'name': 'Jaures Yip', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-111698584,width-700,resizemode-4,imgsize-2262478/img661d3bab1caec1275a701438.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9726648', 'sentiment': -0.08235294117647063, 'wgt': 458525017, 'relevance': 57}

"When Coach Funk yells at us, there\'s always a positive point to her message and it pays off in the end. Coach Funk is like a life coach off the court, helping us with anything we need. "\n\nAccording to Carter, Funk relies on the basics of competition and compassion instead of gimmicks or formulas.\n\n"It just comes down to hard work and dedication to the program," Carter said. "Coach Funk yelled at me a few times, but she\'s the reason I stuck with basketball."\n\nEntering her junior season, Carter was not even sure she wanted to play.\n\n"I had a lot of doubts and just felt done with the game," Carter said. "I had a few long talks with Coach Funk and she pushed me to do my best.

"But you don\'t realize how much you miss something until you start getting back into it."\n\nFunk returned to coaching during the 2017-18 season as an assistant under boys basketball head coach Patrick Damron.\n\n"I wouldn\'t have thought about getting back into basketball until Coach Damron called with the job offer," Funk said.\n\nAfter taking another break, Funk was selected to direct the Eastside girls program for the second time last year.\n\n"I had no desire at all to get back into coaching but I just felt like it was the hand of the Lord opening the door," Funk said. "I credit Coach Damron for helping me reach this point."\n\nAfter the Spartans posted a 24-6 record en route to the 2023 Class 1 title game, Funk was selected as the Bristol Herald Courier coach of the year.\n\n"I knew there was some talent when I took over this program, and it\'s my responsibility to get the most out of each player," Funk said.

Sometimes you have to scream and make corrections."\n\nWhat is Funk\'s bottom-line approach to coaching?\n\n"I believe that if you build trust and have a relationship with your athletes first, they will do anything for you," Funk said. "We have some very strenuous practices at the beginning of the season."\n\nThe extra work is designed to teach the Spartans the importance of defense and team pride.\n\n"I love man-to-man defense," Funk said.\n\nAccording to Carter, the state championship buzz was intense.\n\n"Oh yes, I was on Cloud nine," Carter said. "I will always remember that feeling and this season."\n\nFor Funk, the state championship vibe remains.\n\n"It\'s still sinking in. It was such a blessing to see an amazing group of young ladies come together and make school history," Funk said. "I was in the right place at the right time, and everything just fell into place."\n\nFunk said she doesn\'t look back in bitterness at what happened in her first stint as the Eastside coach.\n\n"There have been times when I maybe want to get back at people. But I believe in the Lord being our avenger, so He took care of all that," Funk said.\n\nThe story of the 2024 Eastside Spartans featured a bonus chapter via an appearance Good Morning America.\n\n"That was completely unexpected and it all started with the girls pranking me on video," Funk said.\n\nSeconds after clinching the state title, the video clip shows the Eastside players sitting in the locker room with dejected expressions.\n\nFunk appeared surprised when she came through the door and started spraying water on her players. But the Eastside players soon surrounded the coach in a celebration dance.\n\n"Lexi made the original post and a couple people shared it. Things went viral from there," Funk said. "It turned into great publicity for our program and school."\n\nFunk was contacted by producers from ESPN before the Good Morning America segment.\n\n"It was an amazing season," Funk said. "I still remember standing at the end of the bench in that state championship game and just absorbing it all, especially the last 30 seconds.\n\n"I\'ve had several people tell me that a movie should be made about all that\'s happened since my first year here in 2011. And I really do think a movie will be made some day."\n\nagregory@bristolnews.com -- Twitter: @Greg_BHCSports <&dateline> (276) 645-2544\n\nagregory@bristolnews.com | Twitter: @Greg_BHCSports | (276) 645-2544\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

That was part of the template that came out of the task force. Future captains would first be groomed as assistants. Captains would stay on as an assistant at the following Ryder Cup. Everyone would be on the same page.\n\nIt\'s what led Phil Mickelson to declare in early 2015 after the task force came up with the plan, "I\'m excited about where we are now, and I\'m excited about where we are headed -- not just into 2016, but really for the next 10 or 20 years."\n\nIs that the end of the task force plan?\n\n"Yes and no," Thomas said at the Scottish Open. "My thing is I want us to pick the best captain. I don\'t want it to feel like it needs to fit a certain résumé; it doesn\'t need to fit this right mold. It\'s like, \'Look, who\'s our best captain right now?\'\n\n"It doesn\'t matter what they\'ve done," he said. "Are the guys going to be excited to play for him? Is he going to mesh with everybody? That\'s all that matters. That\'s something that potentially is the hope going forward. Next year is the only one that matters right now."\n\nDavis Love III was the first captain that came out of the task force for the 2016 matches at Hazeltine, a U.S. victory against a European team that had six rookies, five of whom never played in another Ryder Cup.\n\nHis assistants included Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods. Furyk was the next captain for 2018 in France. His assistants included Stricker, Woods and Zach Johnson. Then it was Stricker\'s turn in Wisconsin. Furyk was an assistant, along with Love (again) and Johnson. And then Johnson got the job for Marco Simone outside Rome.\n\nAnd on it went, the home side winning each time.\n\nIn some respects, Bradley broke the mold. He hasn\'t been involved in a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup since 2014, except for being part of the Netflix docuseries that filmed him getting the awkward call from Johnson that he would not be a captain\'s pick.\n\nRory McIlroy is a keen observer of all things Ryder Cup and was surprised by Bradley choice, like so many others.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"I think Keegan was probably in disbelief, at some point, too," McIlroy said with a smile. "But certainly an interesting pick."\n\nWhen asked whether he felt it was it was a departure from what the Ryder Cup task force set out to do in 2014, McIlroy couldn\'t say except to note that players still had a voice. Thomas, Johnson and Jordan Spieth are on the committee.\n\n"It seems quite reactionary in terms of what happened in Rome," McIlroy said, referring to the Americans losing a seventh consecutive road match.\n\nMost surprising about the selection was that Bradley says he was never interviewed. The first phone call was to offer him the job. Thomas said he played a practice round with Bradley before that phone call and found it "difficult to act normal."\n\nOther names kicked around if Woods wasn\'t interested included Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar. Both had been assistants. That was template.\n\n"I don\'t think anyone is ever an obvious choice, especially going outside the box," Thomas said. "It was very apparent that it wasn\'t an obvious choice in the beginning. I think after everybody got together and talked about it, all of the light bulbs flicked off for all of us at the right time.\n\n"Once that was the thought, there was no other way."\n\nBradley will be 39 next year when the 2025 matches take place at Bethpage Black, making him the youngest captain since Arnold Palmer was 34 and a playing captain in 1963 at East Lake. He was the last playing captain in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBradley also is No. 19 in the world and said flatly he wants to play on the next team if he were to qualify.\n\nThat hasn\'t been a serious consideration for the Ryder Cup since Tom Kite was captain in 1997, the year he was runner-up (by 12 shots) to Woods at the Masters. Kite finished 35th on the PGA Tour money list that year.\n\nWoods was a playing captain at the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne in 2019. He went 3-0, though the Presidents Cup is not in the same league as the Ryder Cup in attention, promotion or the level of external pressure.\n\nAny American team in golf is tough to make these days. Bradley still is a long way off regardless of his world ranking. Thomas thinks it could happen because the U.S. hired former caddie John Wood as team manager to help with the details.\n\nMcIlroy said his name was kicked around for the 2027 matches in Adare Manor in Ireland, especially if Woods is the U.S. captain. Imagine how much hype a Woods-McIlroy captaincy would create.\n\nEven as a fantasy idea, however, McIlroy wasn\'t buying.\n\n"It\'s been mentioned and I\'ve said, \'No way.\' There\'s no way," he said. "If you want to be the best captain you can be, you can\'t play. And if you want to be the best player you can be, you can\'t captain. It\'s one or the other, especially with how big the Ryder Cup has become."', 'source': {'uri': 'omaha.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Omaha.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@omaha.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'seth_wenig@omaha.com', 'name': 'Seth Wenig', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/64/e6410791-3bd8-5f80-9b96-96f66f6b8670/6691a680c6f4c.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 458521521, 'relevance': 51}

That, despite losing five seniors, including four starters, from the previous season that finished 22-6, losing in the Class 2 state quarterfinals for a second straight year.\n\n"Honestly going into the season I didn\'t have high expectations for this team," said Julius Gallishaw, entering his fifth year as Virginia High head coach. "I just wanted us to do the best we could. I knew I had some talent there and I knew if we played hard we could be in games.\n\n"My kids worked their tails off. I know other teams do that as well, but they were always in the gym, they were lifting weights on their own, they really wanted to be successful. I think that was the biggest thing, them doing that and I had a good staff with me and supporting me. All of it kind of fell into place."\n\nPeople are also reading...

All Virginia High did was finish 23-6, win the Southwest District regular season and tournament titles and the Region 2D titles for the second year in a row. They kept going from there, advancing to the Class 2 state semifinals for the first time since 2012 and reaching the Class 2 state championship game for the first time in 64 years.\n\nNo wonder Gallishaw has been selected as the Bristol Herald boys basketball coach of the year, the second time he had earned those honors in the last three seasons.\n\n"I really do thank God, He is the head of my life," said Gallishaw, who won a state championship as a teammate of NBA legend Ray Allen at Hillcrest High School in South Carolina in 1993, and also had a standout career at the now-defunct Virginia Intermont College. "I couldn\'t have this opportunity without Him, without my family. I just appreciate the award."\n\nBeing a coach isn\'t for everybody. Gallishaw is done just fine, leading the Bearcats to an average of 21 wins over the last three seasons. He is ably assisted by former University of Virginia\'s College at Wise standout Parker Gemmell and Derrick Lee, who played point guard at Virginia High and at Bluefield College (now University).\n\n"Certain players just don\'t have the coaching ability. They are good players, but they just don\'t have that coaching ability," Gallishaw said. "Coach Parker and Coach Lee, they have that ability. They help me out tremendously in situations where I am asking questions, what to do here and what to do here. I just thank the Lord for people like that helping me out on my staff."\n\nGallishaw learned well, playing for James Smith, who won five state high school championships in South Carolina, and Phil Worrell at Virginia Intermont. He also worked under Barry Wade at Tennessee High and George Pitts at King University. All that prepared him for his chance that came four years ago.\n\n"I will be honest with you, I knew graduating college that I wanted to be a coach," Gallishaw said. "In that aspect when I was high school I got a little bit from my high school coach who won five state championships in South Carolina. I was blessed to have Coach Worrell and just got a little bit from him.\n\n"Then I was blessed to be under some good coaches as an assistant coach. Coach Wade at Tennessee High School, Coach Pitts at King, I was blessed to be under those guys and I just kind of got things right there, kind of how to deal with players, how to execute on the offensive end and the defensive end, things of that nature from them."\n\nHe learned well. Among the seniors that left after the 2023 season was Dante Worley, the Region 2D player of the year, who is now playing at UVa-Wise. Up stepped Deonte Mozell, a junior last year at Virginia High, who earned Virginia High School League Class 2 second team all-state honors.\n\n"Dante was a big part of our success those previous years because we didn\'t have to worry about things that some coaches have to worry about, like dribbling the ball, getting the ball down in the press and getting us in our offense and things of that nature," Gallishaw said. "Obviously there were some question marks going into the season about losing Dante.\n\n"Our guys started playing in the gym all the time and working out all the time. That was Deonte, he was a gym rat and he still is. He just got in there, worked his butt off to get better each day. We were a little cautious about that going into the season, we didn\'t miss a beat going in there with Deonte."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nThere were plenty of other contributors, from rising senior Te\'ron Woolen, rising sophomores Landon Lee and Ollie Carpenter and departed seniors Jalen Lang and Ethan Carpenter, who was lost for the season in January with a knee injury.\n\n"I am going to keep on bragging my team. Sometimes coaching can be overrated," Gallishaw said. "My guys, instead of them growing apart during that time, losing a big guy like Ethan because he is so good. Losing somebody like him can tear a team apart, they came together more and worked as a team more. Going into there and being a coach of that and seeing those guys instead of getting down on themselves and making excuses, going out there and fighting. You can\'t be nothing but happy for those kids."\n\nVirginia High had just six losses during the season, three to Tennessee schools. Two came against Tennessee High, including a close loss at the Bearcat Den when all-state guard Colin Brown willed the Vikings to victory. That is when Gallishaw realized these Bearcats might be special.\n\n"Tennessee High is really good. I knew that we were going to be pretty good going into that game and giving them everything they wanted during that game," Gallishaw said. "It came down to one shot at the end of the game so I knew at that particular time that we had something special going into the district."\n\nAll Virginia High did after that loss was go 20-2, with the lone losses coming to Wise County Central by two points and Graham, one of five meetings between the schools, with the Bearcats winning four of them. That included a halfcourt buzzer-beater by Woolen to claim the Region 2D crown and the \'Cats earned a two-point win over the G-Men in the state semifinals at Lebanon.\n\nAll that awaited in Richmond was John Marshall, one of the nation\'s top programs, a squad that has drawn the ire of coaches across Virginia due to a roster full of transfers and a head coach who is also involved with the Team Loaded AAU program. The Justices have won four of the last five Class 2 state titles, and the one they didn\'t win was because they didn\'t play due to COVID in 2020.\n\n"To be honest obviously playing in a state championship was a blessing for us and everything, but I couldn\'t help but being disheartened for my guys because they deserved more of a chance to actually win the state championship," Gallishaw said. "I am not here to diminish what John Marshall did during that time because I don\'t think that is my place, but I felt like we were deserving to at least compete in that state championship and we didn\'t get that opportunity like we wanted it.\n\n"Obviously that is a great program and they do a good job over there, but I felt like my guys deserved more of an opportunity. That is all."\n\nVirginia High led 2-0 on a Mozell basket and were within 18-11 after one quarter before the Justices poured it on, earning an 89-32 rout of the Bearcats, who never quit playing hard.\n\n"That is thing with my guys, I have never had to teach effort," Gallishaw said. "I can teach Xs and Os and stuff like that, but my guys always bring the effort and I am just proud of my guys for doing that. Even when that game got away from us in the state championship game my guys kept on playing. I was happy about that."\n\nGallishaw, who credits being able to develop strong relationships with his players through his role as a physical education teacher at Virginia High, won\'t let his Bearcats forget the process it took to get to that point.\n\n"I try to relate to them as much as possible on a one-on-one level and talk to them and see what is going on in their world," he said. "I think the beauty of being a coach is getting to know these kids on their level and knowing that they know that you care and that goes a long way with them playing hard and really running through a wall for you because they know you care. That is my biggest thing...\n\n"I think being in school and being around those kids every day and getting to talk to them on an individual basis is one of the biggest keys."\n\nDon\'t count out another run for the Bearcats, who have been in the weight room this summer, while also attending camps at UVa-Wise and Milligan. Four starters return and they will face a tougher schedule, with Virginia High slated to play in the Arby\'s Classic for the first time since the inaugural event in 1983.\n\n"What I told my kids was, \'Hey, treat every game like it is a championship game, don\'t go into games assuming we are Virginia High and we are pretty good and we are just going to win ball games. That is not how it works\'," said Gallishaw, "The beauty of sports is that you never know. A team could just come in your back door and just beat you. We put our head down and just took it one game at a time and the next thing you know we are in the state championship.\n\n"Hats off to the guys, man, they did an excellent job."\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'heraldcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HeraldCourier.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/b6/eb6c9292-3bd3-11ef-b713-27147de93e6a/66919db17e28b.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.4274509803921569, 'wgt': 458521485, 'relevance': 51}

Furyk was the next captain for 2018 in France. His assistants included Stricker, Woods and Zach Johnson. Then it was Stricker\'s turn in Wisconsin.

If his three assists before the semifinals hinted at his undoubted promise, Yamal\'s spectacular curling shot that propelled Spain to a 2-1 win over France in the last four signaled a new star had arrived.\n\n"He\'s a generational talent," England striker Ollie Watkins said Friday of Yamal. "He has got the world at his feet."\n\nWhile Yamal and fellow winger Nico Williams now offer their national team a hitherto-lacking directness out wide, it\'s the central midfield that has given Spain the edge over all of its rivals.\n\nRodri, perhaps pound-for-pound the world\'s most effective player, and Fabian Ruiz are the axis from which Spain thrives. Dani Olmo has joined them as the most attacking of pretty much a complete central-midfield three that England will struggle to contain.\n\nSpain topped a group containing defending champion Italy and 2022 World Cup semifinalist Croatia, before eliminating host nation Germany and Mbappé\'s France, for many the pre-tournament favorite.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt\'s six straight wins for La Roja. No wonder they are being so heavily backed ahead of the final.\n\n"They have been the best team," England coach Gareth Southgate said of Spain. "... but we are there and from what we have shown to this point, we have as good a chance as they do."\n\nIndeed, Spain should not underestimate England, whose tenacity and character have stood out way above its quality of play at Euro 2024. The nation\'s most talented squad for 20 years has underperformed, looking unbalanced, short of ideas and in some cases fatigued, but has somehow scrapped through to a second straight European Championship final.\n\nThree years ago, England lost to Italy in a penalty shootout on home soil at Wembley Stadium, extending the birthplace of soccer\'s painful wait for a major men\'s title since its one and only at the 1966 World Cup.\n\nSouthgate\'s team is back in the title match -- its first ever outside England -- and is an increasingly confident underdog, with potential matchwinners dotted throughout the team in Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka and Kane. Someone has always popped up with a crucial goal -- Bellingham with the stoppage-time equalizer against Slovakia in the last 16, Saka with the 80th-minute equalizer against Switzerland in the quarterfinals, even backup striker Watkins pretty much exactly on 90 minutes against the Netherlands in the semifinals.\n\nWho will come to Southgate\'s rescue on Sunday -- if indeed someone does?\n\n"They are able to inflict a lot of damage, even without playing in a very fluid way," Spain defender Dani Vivian said. "But they have that quality that makes them able to produce those sparks."\n\nThe smart money, though, is on Spain winning a seventh straight game to clinch a record fourth European Championship title.\n\nIt would be a just end to a tournament where few teams really clicked apart from the Spanish, who have dovetailed a more ruthless attacking edge with their longstanding possession game that perhaps peaked in the Euro 2012 final when a team of midfielders -- notably Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Xabi Alonso and David Silva -- ran over Italy in Spain\'s 4-0 win.\n\nThe class of 2024 might not have those names, but they\'d be worthy successors.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'nwitimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'nwi.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'assets@nwitimes.com', 'name': 'assets', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'tncms@nwitimes.com', 'name': 'tncms', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/9e/f9e25042-1f48-5310-85bf-5022b250507d/6691a4f9e6cfc.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9729240', 'sentiment': 0.4980392156862745, 'wgt': 458521161, 'relevance': 5}

That was part of the template that came out of the task force. Future captains would first be groomed as assistants. Captains would stay on as an assistant at the following Ryder Cup. Everyone would be on the same page.\n\nIt\'s what led Phil Mickelson to declare in early 2015 after the task force came up with the plan, "I\'m excited about where we are now, and I\'m excited about where we are headed -- not just into 2016, but really for the next 10 or 20 years."\n\nPeople are also reading... 3 dead in plane crash near McDowell, Rutherford county line Plane crashes in McDowell; emergency crews ask people to avoid Brackett Town Road McDowell County Schools moving principals at West Middle, Eastfield and Foothills school Marion man meets McDowell paramedic who saved his life 24 years ago 3 from South Carolina die in Nebo plane crash; national safety board investigating Marion NC man\'s charges upgraded to felony after assault on 79-year-old Body found Sunday was Marion man; cause of death pending toxicology report Marion NC man charged with breaking into home, assault Hickory pastor has a license to practice law.

"My thing is I want us to pick the best captain. I don\'t want it to feel like it needs to fit a certain résumé; it doesn\'t need to fit this right mold. It\'s like, \'Look, who\'s our best captain right now?\'\n\n"It doesn\'t matter what they\'ve done," he said. "Are the guys going to be excited to play for him? Is he going to mesh with everybody? That\'s all that matters. That\'s something that potentially is the hope going forward. Next year is the only one that matters right now."\n\nDavis Love III was the first captain that came out of the task force for the 2016 matches at Hazeltine, a U.S. victory against a European team that had six rookies, five of whom never played in another Ryder Cup.\n\nHis assistants included Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods. Furyk was the next captain for 2018 in France. His assistants included Stricker, Woods and Zach Johnson. Then it was Stricker\'s turn in Wisconsin. Furyk was an assistant, along with Love (again) and Johnson. And then Johnson got the job for Marco Simone outside Rome.\n\nAnd on it went, the home side winning each time.\n\nIn some respects, Bradley broke the mold. He hasn\'t been involved in a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup since 2014, except for being part of the Netflix docuseries that filmed him getting the awkward call from Johnson that he would not be a captain\'s pick.\n\nRory McIlroy is a keen observer of all things Ryder Cup and was surprised by Bradley choice, like so many others.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"I think Keegan was probably in disbelief, at some point, too," McIlroy said with a smile. "But certainly an interesting pick."\n\nWhen asked whether he felt it was it was a departure from what the Ryder Cup task force set out to do in 2014, McIlroy couldn\'t say except to note that players still had a voice. Thomas, Johnson and Jordan Spieth are on the committee.\n\n"It seems quite reactionary in terms of what happened in Rome," McIlroy said, referring to the Americans losing a seventh consecutive road match.\n\nMost surprising about the selection was that Bradley says he was never interviewed. The first phone call was to offer him the job. Thomas said he played a practice round with Bradley before that phone call and found it "difficult to act normal."\n\nOther names kicked around if Woods wasn\'t interested included Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar. Both had been assistants. That was template.\n\n"I don\'t think anyone is ever an obvious choice, especially going outside the box," Thomas said. "It was very apparent that it wasn\'t an obvious choice in the beginning. I think after everybody got together and talked about it, all of the light bulbs flicked off for all of us at the right time.\n\n"Once that was the thought, there was no other way."\n\nBradley will be 39 next year when the 2025 matches take place at Bethpage Black, making him the youngest captain since Arnold Palmer was 34 and a playing captain in 1963 at East Lake. He was the last playing captain in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBradley also is No. 19 in the world and said flatly he wants to play on the next team if he were to qualify.\n\nThat hasn\'t been a serious consideration for the Ryder Cup since Tom Kite was captain in 1997, the year he was runner-up (by 12 shots) to Woods at the Masters. Kite finished 35th on the PGA Tour money list that year.\n\nWoods was a playing captain at the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne in 2019. He went 3-0, though the Presidents Cup is not in the same league as the Ryder Cup in attention, promotion or the level of external pressure.\n\nAny American team in golf is tough to make these days. Bradley still is a long way off regardless of his world ranking. Thomas thinks it could happen because the U.S. hired former caddie John Wood as team manager to help with the details.\n\nMcIlroy said his name was kicked around for the 2027 matches in Adare Manor in Ireland, especially if Woods is the U.S. captain.

McAmis won 241 games while serving as the head boys basketball coach of J.J. Kelly, Twin Springs and Wise Central.\n\n"I was able to attend dad\'s basketball camps, practices and games growing up and that really brought out my love for the sport," Emmah said.\n\nOver time, Emmah learned that no prize comes without hours of preparation.\n\n"I took in everything I possibly could at an early age and still remember much of what dad taught his players," McAmis said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

"My family never took it easy on me, and they taught me many valuable life lessons that shaped who I am today."\n\nIn three seasons at Wise Central, Emmah McAmis scored 2,203 points and generated an assortment of headlines and highlights that have attracted the attention of college recruiters at all levels.\n\nWith McAmis setting a torrid pace on offense, the Wise Central Warriors have advanced to the VHSL Class 2 title game three years with two wins and a runner-up finish.\n\n"My overall goal was to win state all four years, but coming up short in my sophomore motivated me," McAmis said. "We\'re held to a high standard here and I enjoy that."\n\nThe taskmaster for the Wise Central Warriors is veteran coach Robin Dotson.\n\n"Emmah\'s impact on our program has been invaluable," Dotson said. "Her competitiveness and drive are off the charts. And Emmah is just so athletic that she presents matchup nightmares for opposing teams."\n\nDotson pointed to another dimension that elevates McAmis above the crowd.\n\n"The bigger the game, the bigger Emmah plays," Dotson said.\n\nIn the 2024 Class 2 championship, McAmis delivered 27 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals as the Warriors posted a 58-41 win against John Marshall.\n\nFor the season, she averaged 24.2 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.4 assists. That was enough to earn Bristol Herald Courier player of the year honors.\n\n"I don\'t think words can explain the feeling of winning a state title," McAmis said. "The accomplishment is just so satisfying. I think about those games daily."\n\nMcAmis embraces challenge. For example, there is the issue of her size at five-foot-seven.\n\n"I hit my last grow spurt after this past basketball season, so I think I am done growing," McAmis said. "There are times that I wish I was taller.\n\n"There are also times that I like my height because I\'ve heard many people say that I\'m too short and I\'ll never make it. That gives me motivation to prove those people wrong and show that height doesn\'t matter."\n\nMcAmis has been silencing critics for years, on the high school, travel ball and camp level.\n\n"Once I reached a certain age, my dad actually started letting me practice with his teams," McAmis said. "I was able to do the drills and scrimmage against the boys. I just loved being the around the game and was super excited when I had the chance to play for Coach Dotson."\n\nThe travel ball grind stated in the eighth grade. After facing regional competition with the Nautilus Express squad, McAmis moved to the Under Armour Circuit and the West Virginia Thunder.\n\n"I\'ve played in a bunch of different states over the past five years, McAmis said. "There is a lot of talent on the Under Armor Circuit, and many of the girls I have played against have signed with NCAA Division 1 college. That experience has definitely helped me to better my skills."\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nMcAmis said she has received offers from the likes of Western Carolina, East Tennessee State, Colgate, Appalachian State, Marshall, Purdue, Fort Wayne, Wofford, and Youngstown State.\n\n"I\'ve taken six visits, but all were unofficial," McAmis said. "I plan to take more visits after my travel ball season is over.\n\n"Sometimes the recruiting process can be a little stressful, but at the same time it\'s very fun. Not every player gets this experience, so I\'m so thankful for the opportunities."\n\nAs for her much anticipated decision, McAmis said she\' in the exploratory phase.\n\n"I\'m still not sure where I\'m at with that process, but I hope to make a decision before basketball season starts this winter," McAmis said.\n\nFor now, McAmis is testing her skills against taller and quicker opponents in her version of hoops summer school.\n\n"I want to be a complete player for my senior year," McAmis said. "My ability to get to the rim and either finish under the rim or get my teammates open is something that sets me apart, but I\'m still working on the consistency of my 3-point shot and just gaining more confidence."\n\nThe pace is fast for McAmis, but she manages to keep her eyes on the ultimate prize.\n\n"I actually have my trophies in my room on a shelf and it\'s the first thing I see when I walk in," McAmis said. "Whether I\'m having a bad day or good day, seeing those trophies help me to keep pushing for my goals."\n\nHow does McAmis want to wrap up the high school version of her basketball love story?\n\n"With another state championship," McAmis said. "I\'ve worked hard and been blessed with great coaches and teammates through the years.\n\n"Now, I want to keep building my legacy at Wise Central with one more accomplishment."\n\n*\n\nAll-BHC Girls Basketball Team\n\nPlayer of Year: Emmah McAmis, Wise County Central\n\nCoach of Year: Terri Anne Hill Funk, Eastside\n\nFirst Team\n\nTaylor Clay, Eastside\n\nEmmah McAmis, Wise County Central\n\nAnnsley Trivette, Abingdon\n\nAlayna McNulty, Honaker\n\nAddie Wilhoit, Tennessee High\n\nSecond Team\n\nJaydyn Carrico, Gate City\n\nMadison Looney, Wise County Central\n\nElla Moss, Marion\n\nMakaylan Luttrell, George Wythe\n\nTailor Nolley, Honaker\n\nagregory@bristolnews.com -- Twitter: @Greg_BHCSports <&dateline> (276) 645-2544\n\nagregory@bristolnews.com | Twitter: @Greg_BHCSports | (276) 645-2544\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'heraldcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HeraldCourier.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/7a/37a2ac6c-3fdc-11ef-8112-8b23c83e3d4b/66919d7b8741d.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.3960784313725489, 'wgt': 458519629, 'relevance': 26}

If his three assists before the semifinals hinted at his undoubted promise, Yamal\'s spectacular curling shot that propelled Spain to a 2-1 win over France in the last four signaled a new star had arrived.\n\n"He\'s a generational talent," England striker Ollie Watkins said Friday of Yamal. "He has got the world at his feet."\n\nWhile Yamal and fellow winger Nico Williams now offer their national team a hitherto-lacking directness out wide, it\'s the central midfield that has given Spain the edge over all of its rivals.\n\nRodri, perhaps pound-for-pound the world\'s most effective player, and Fabian Ruiz are the axis from which Spain thrives. Dani Olmo has joined them as the most attacking of pretty much a complete central-midfield three that England will struggle to contain.\n\nSpain topped a group containing defending champion Italy and 2022 World Cup semifinalist Croatia, before eliminating host nation Germany and Mbappé\'s France, for many the pre-tournament favorite.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt\'s six straight wins for La Roja. No wonder they are being so heavily backed ahead of the final.\n\n"They have been the best team," England coach Gareth Southgate said of Spain. "... but we are there and from what we have shown to this point, we have as good a chance as they do."\n\nIndeed, Spain should not underestimate England, whose tenacity and character have stood out way above its quality of play at Euro 2024. The nation\'s most talented squad for 20 years has underperformed, looking unbalanced, short of ideas and in some cases fatigued, but has somehow scrapped through to a second straight European Championship final.\n\nThree years ago, England lost to Italy in a penalty shootout on home soil at Wembley Stadium, extending the birthplace of soccer\'s painful wait for a major men\'s title since its one and only at the 1966 World Cup.\n\nSouthgate\'s team is back in the title match -- its first ever outside England -- and is an increasingly confident underdog, with potential matchwinners dotted throughout the team in Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka and Kane. Someone has always popped up with a crucial goal -- Bellingham with the stoppage-time equalizer against Slovakia in the last 16, Saka with the 80th-minute equalizer against Switzerland in the quarterfinals, even backup striker Watkins pretty much exactly on 90 minutes against the Netherlands in the semifinals.\n\nWho will come to Southgate\'s rescue on Sunday -- if indeed someone does?\n\n"They are able to inflict a lot of damage, even without playing in a very fluid way," Spain defender Dani Vivian said. "But they have that quality that makes them able to produce those sparks."\n\nThe smart money, though, is on Spain winning a seventh straight game to clinch a record fourth European Championship title.\n\nIt would be a just end to a tournament where few teams really clicked apart from the Spanish, who have dovetailed a more ruthless attacking edge with their longstanding possession game that perhaps peaked in the Euro 2012 final when a team of midfielders -- notably Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Xabi Alonso and David Silva -- ran over Italy in Spain\'s 4-0 win.\n\nThe class of 2024 might not have those names, but they\'d be worthy successors.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'magicvalley.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Magic Valley'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@magicvalley.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magicvalley.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/f2/bf220751-7c86-5f7d-bd3f-647a7f131fd5/6691a4f974407.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9729240', 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 458519400, 'relevance': 51}

That was part of the template that came out of the task force. Future captains would first be groomed as assistants. Captains would stay on as an assistant at the following Ryder Cup. Everyone would be on the same page.\n\nIt\'s what led Phil Mickelson to declare in early 2015 after the task force came up with the plan, "I\'m excited about where we are now, and I\'m excited about where we are headed -- not just into 2016, but really for the next 10 or 20 years."\n\nPeople are also reading...

"My thing is I want us to pick the best captain. I don\'t want it to feel like it needs to fit a certain résumé; it doesn\'t need to fit this right mold. It\'s like, \'Look, who\'s our best captain right now?\'\n\n"It doesn\'t matter what they\'ve done," he said. "Are the guys going to be excited to play for him? Is he going to mesh with everybody? That\'s all that matters. That\'s something that potentially is the hope going forward. Next year is the only one that matters right now."\n\nDavis Love III was the first captain that came out of the task force for the 2016 matches at Hazeltine, a U.S. victory against a European team that had six rookies, five of whom never played in another Ryder Cup.\n\nHis assistants included Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods. Furyk was the next captain for 2018 in France. His assistants included Stricker, Woods and Zach Johnson. Then it was Stricker\'s turn in Wisconsin. Furyk was an assistant, along with Love (again) and Johnson. And then Johnson got the job for Marco Simone outside Rome.\n\nAnd on it went, the home side winning each time.\n\nIn some respects, Bradley broke the mold. He hasn\'t been involved in a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup since 2014, except for being part of the Netflix docuseries that filmed him getting the awkward call from Johnson that he would not be a captain\'s pick.\n\nRory McIlroy is a keen observer of all things Ryder Cup and was surprised by Bradley choice, like so many others.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"I think Keegan was probably in disbelief, at some point, too," McIlroy said with a smile. "But certainly an interesting pick."\n\nWhen asked whether he felt it was it was a departure from what the Ryder Cup task force set out to do in 2014, McIlroy couldn\'t say except to note that players still had a voice. Thomas, Johnson and Jordan Spieth are on the committee.\n\n"It seems quite reactionary in terms of what happened in Rome," McIlroy said, referring to the Americans losing a seventh consecutive road match.\n\nMost surprising about the selection was that Bradley says he was never interviewed. The first phone call was to offer him the job. Thomas said he played a practice round with Bradley before that phone call and found it "difficult to act normal."\n\nOther names kicked around if Woods wasn\'t interested included Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar. Both had been assistants. That was template.\n\n"I don\'t think anyone is ever an obvious choice, especially going outside the box," Thomas said. "It was very apparent that it wasn\'t an obvious choice in the beginning. I think after everybody got together and talked about it, all of the light bulbs flicked off for all of us at the right time.\n\n"Once that was the thought, there was no other way."\n\nBradley will be 39 next year when the 2025 matches take place at Bethpage Black, making him the youngest captain since Arnold Palmer was 34 and a playing captain in 1963 at East Lake. He was the last playing captain in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBradley also is No. 19 in the world and said flatly he wants to play on the next team if he were to qualify.\n\nThat hasn\'t been a serious consideration for the Ryder Cup since Tom Kite was captain in 1997, the year he was runner-up (by 12 shots) to Woods at the Masters. Kite finished 35th on the PGA Tour money list that year.\n\nWoods was a playing captain at the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne in 2019. He went 3-0, though the Presidents Cup is not in the same league as the Ryder Cup in attention, promotion or the level of external pressure.\n\nAny American team in golf is tough to make these days. Bradley still is a long way off regardless of his world ranking. Thomas thinks it could happen because the U.S. hired former caddie John Wood as team manager to help with the details.\n\nMcIlroy said his name was kicked around for the 2027 matches in Adare Manor in Ireland, especially if Woods is the U.S. captain. Imagine how much hype a Woods-McIlroy captaincy would create.\n\nEven as a fantasy idea, however, McIlroy wasn\'t buying.\n\n"It\'s been mentioned and I\'ve said, \'No way.\' There\'s no way," he said. "If you want to be the best captain you can be, you can\'t play. And if you want to be the best player you can be, you can\'t captain. It\'s one or the other, especially with how big the Ryder Cup has become."\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'magicvalley.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Magic Valley'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@magicvalley.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}, {'uri': 'seth_wenig@magicvalley.com', 'name': 'Seth Wenig', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magicvalley.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/0d/90d0f7a8-2822-5448-ac57-129c2223eaae/6691a68018c8b.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9727963', 'sentiment': 0.04313725490196085, 'wgt': 458519358, 'relevance': 51}

After fleeing war and persecution at home, 36 athletes from 11 countries will compete in the Paris Games as part of the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nThe team was created for the Rio Olympics in 2016 as a symbol of hope and to call attention to the plight of refugees worldwide.\n\nIn Paris, the refugee athletes will take the stage at a time of record global migration, with hundreds of millions of people -- many of them displaced from their homes -- working to reinvent themselves just as these athletes have.\n\nThe record migration comes alongside a rise in far-right populism across much of the world, with officials and parties in many countries promising to clamp down on immigration and asylum.\n\nAt the Games, athletes will compete in a host country where the anti-immigration far-right party saw a surge of voter support in parliamentary elections, but was beaten back by a coalition of the French left and failed to win a majority.\n\nThe refugee athletes will compete in 12 sports, but for many, their journey to Paris is already a victory in itself.\n\nFernando Dayán Jorge, Cuban, canoeing\n\nFernando Dayán Jorge spent his childhood flying past rickety fishing boats and colonial houses in the bay next to his home in Cienfuegos, Cuba.\n\nSince he began practicing there with his father when he was 11, he said it feels as if he\'s lived a thousand lifetimes.\n\nThe 25-year-old canoeist was a two-time Olympian for Cuba\'s national team in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Then, a gold medalist. A deserter of the Cuban team. A migrant. A maintenance worker. And a refugee.\n\nNow, he continues to rocket along on his narrow red-and-white canoe, this time flying past suburban homes in the canals winding through Cape Coral, Florida.\n\nKneeling on his boat, his oar slices through the air as his coach chants "very good work, very good work" from a boat next to him.\n\nJorge\'s eyes are fixed ahead, throwing all his force into his third Olympics.\n\n"After having written off the 2024 Paris Olympics, it\'s a massive opportunity," he said. "There are so many Cubans that come to this country and lose this dream of competing once again, simply because they don\'t know how to get back to this place."\n\nJorge was at the top of his career, having won gold in Tokyo for the 1,000-meter canoe sprint, when he took a daunting step in March 2021. While training in Mexico, Jorge defected, joining a growing number of Cuban athletes in deserting their country amid an ongoing migratory flight.\n\nSome hope to make more money than they can in the communist-run island. Others, like Jorge, say they left because of political differences over how the government treats citizens and athletes.\n\nHe left behind his home and crossed into the United States via the Rio Grande, in hopes of a better -- if uncertain -- life.\n\nArriving to Florida was, in some ways, like starting from scratch. Granted refugee status in the U.S., Jorge said he would wake up hours before sunrise to train, then work eight hours in a maintenance gig to pay his bills.\n\nHe said he watched friends forced to give up everything after migrating, but he fought to continue as a professional athlete.\n\n"I had a hard time getting out of bed every day and keeping my head on straight," he said. "I had no support whatsoever."\n\nBecoming one of the first Cubans to compete on the Refugee Olympic Team changed everything for him, he said. Still, he is among those who\'ve struggled to cover the costs of competing internationally. He opened a GoFundMe page in June to help pay his way to the Games.\n\nCuba has protested the inclusion of Jorge and Cuban weightlifter Ramiro Mora on the team, saying they should not be considered refugees.\n\nToday, Jorge\'s life in Cuba and his future in Florida seem to blend together in his home. His red, blue and white Cuba jersey sits framed over his doorway, while medals from competitions in the U.S. hang over a statue of the Olympic emblem.\n\n"To the refugees and athletes who\'ve been through the same thing, I want to tell them to not give up," he said. "No matter how dark the days become, the sun is always going to rise."\n\n"I\'m here because I want to reach my dream. Not because I\'m scared," she declared from Spain, where she was granted asylum.\n\nOn the outskirts of Madrid, the 21-year-old is training hard for the Games, which for the first time will include breaking, or, as it\'s popularly known, breakdancing. Talash prances and swivels on her hands and feet to the beat of hip-hop, swooshing her black and red hair around before striking a pose signaling the end of her performance.\n\nJust months ago, she was working in a hair salon in the town of Huesca. Talash was among hundreds of Afghans brought to Spain aboard military planes following the return of the Taliban to power in August 2021.\n\nTalash first came across breaking at age 17. She saw a social media video of a man spinning on his head and was skeptical -- it must have been fake, generated by AI, she thought. But the images were real, and she said she soon became obsessed with the sport, scrolling through video after video on her phone.\n\n"I wanted to do it, I wanted to learn it," she said.\n\nShe found a club in Kabul where a dancer from the videos trained and knocked at the door. "There were 55 boys, and I was the only girl," she said. "I told myself, why can\'t a girl do this?"\n\nBreaking in some ways freed her from the problems facing young women in Afghanistan. But it wasn\'t long before Talash was noticed -- international news outlets published stories about the young Afghan woman defying cultural and religious norms. That was enough to become a target.\n\n"The Taliban don\'t like it when a girl dances," she said, even though breaking is more than that -- it\'s a sport.\n\nHer club began receiving threats, Talash said, and one day, when a bomb hit very close, local police asked them to shut down over the dangers.\n\nShe trained behind closed doors in her home until the Taliban\'s return to power. Despite initial promises that women\'s rights wouldn\'t be curtailed, women have since been barred from studying and face several restrictions on employment, travel and health.\n\n"Now, girls can\'t do anything," Talash said.\n\nShe\'s had little time to train while adapting to a foreign country, and at some points, competing in the Games seemed unfathomable.\n\n"But when my friend told me I could join the refugee team, I was so happy," Talash said. "I can now fly."\n\nMohammad Amin Alsalami, Syrian, athletics\n\nWhen Mohammad Amin Alsalami arrived in Berlin in October 2015, he was cold, lonely and homesick.\n\nThe Syrian refugee had left behind his war-torn hometown of Aleppo, fled to Turkey, crossed the Mediterranean on a rubber boat to Greece, and trekked by foot to Germany. Like millions of other migrants, he was in search of a place where he could build a future without bombs and violence.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Alsalami, 29, has been granted asylum, learned German and made new friends. And he\'s living his dream of becoming a world-class athlete.\n\nHe learned just months ago that he got the green light to participate in the Paris Games.\n\n"That moment was so wow," he said. "I get to go to the Olympics. I cried so much. It was really cool."\n\nAlsalami discovered his passion for athletics during physical education in school at age 15. A teacher noticed his talent for long jump and pushed him to participate in local and national competitions in Syria. But when civil war erupted, he could no longer practice. His family -- he\'s the youngest of nine siblings and comes from a family of tailors -- was displaced several times within Syria, then fled to Turkey. Alsalami decided to continue on to Europe on his own.\n\nHe credits his passion for athletics with getting him through the initial hardships in his new country.\n\nDuring the first weeks in Berlin, he looked up different stadiums and gyms on Google maps so he could start practicing long jump again. He remembers walking through the first snow to finally discover one of the city\'s big indoor gymnasiums.\n\n"All the other Berlin track and field athletes were training in this hall," he said. "When I came in and saw how full and how warm it was inside ... it was almost like paradise for me."\n\nOn that first day, a man watched him jump, approached him and asked something in German.\n\n"I didn\'t understand anything, not in English either," Alsalami said. "And then I said \'Hey, I\'m Syrian\' on my cellphone, and he said \'I\'m your trainer from now on.\'"\n\nHe stayed with that first coach for five years, then moved on to a different one -- and said he\'s eternally grateful to both for their support.\n\nDespite his excitement for the Games, Alsalami admits he\'s a bit sad that he can\'t represent his home country.\n\n"Syria is home, I miss it every day," he said. "In the end, that\'s my country, that\'s where I come from."\n\nIman Mahdavi, Iranian, wrestling\n\nIman Mahdavi smiles and dishes up Iranian food that he\'s cooked himself at his Milan home.\n\n"If my mum could see me now," he said with a laugh. "She wouldn\'t believe it."\n\nMahdavi hasn\'t seen his mother since October 2020, when the Iranian wrestler fled his home country over fears for his life.\n\nWith only the clothes he was wearing, Mahdavi made a harrowing journey by foot from Iran to Turkey, then flew to Italy and applied for asylum.\n\n"I didn\'t even really know where I was flying to," said Mahdavi, 29. "Luckily for me, it was Italy."\n\nOnce he was granted asylum, one of Mahdavi\'s first aims was to continue wrestling. His father, once a wrestler himself, had instilled in his son a passion. Mahdavi became a seven-time national junior champion and won more than 50 medals.\n\nThrough a friend he connected with on Instagram, Mahdavi was introduced to a gym on the outskirts of Milan.\n\n"As soon as we had him in the gym, in his first training sessions, we immediately saw that he was an extraordinary athlete, that he was a very, very high-level wrestler," said Giuseppe Gammarota, president of Lotta Club Seggiano. "We immediately started preparing him for competitions."\n\nThe gym has become like family to him -- so much so that he calls his coach, Marco Moroni, "Papi."\n\nMahdavi said his real father died of a heart attack several years ago after being mistakenly told his son died in a car crash.\n\nIt was Moroni who helped Mahdavi find a job, as a nightclub bouncer.\n\nMahdavi admits the schedule can be tough: He works from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., goes home to sleep, then trains every day. But he has a focus that drives him.\n\n"The Olympics is a dream for any athlete who does any sport," he said. "I hope to come back from the Olympics with the best colored medal I can get. And I will also be thinking about the next Olympics, hoping I\'m still in form."\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Rebecca Blackwell and Daniel Kozin in Cape Coral, Florida, and Iain Sullivan in Madrid contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore Paris Olympics news: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games', 'source': {'uri': 'wnewsj.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Wilmington News Journal'}, 'authors': [], 'image': None, 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 458519107, 'relevance': 7}

That was part of the template that came out of the task force. Future captains would first be groomed as assistants. Captains would stay on as an assistant at the following Ryder Cup. Everyone would be on the same page.\n\nIt\'s what led Phil Mickelson to declare in early 2015 after the task force came up with the plan, "I\'m excited about where we are now, and I\'m excited about where we are headed -- not just into 2016, but really for the next 10 or 20 years."\n\nPeople are also reading...

"My thing is I want us to pick the best captain. I don\'t want it to feel like it needs to fit a certain résumé; it doesn\'t need to fit this right mold. It\'s like, \'Look, who\'s our best captain right now?\'\n\n"It doesn\'t matter what they\'ve done," he said. "Are the guys going to be excited to play for him? Is he going to mesh with everybody? That\'s all that matters. That\'s something that potentially is the hope going forward. Next year is the only one that matters right now."\n\nDavis Love III was the first captain that came out of the task force for the 2016 matches at Hazeltine, a U.S. victory against a European team that had six rookies, five of whom never played in another Ryder Cup.\n\nHis assistants included Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods. Furyk was the next captain for 2018 in France. His assistants included Stricker, Woods and Zach Johnson. Then it was Stricker\'s turn in Wisconsin. Furyk was an assistant, along with Love (again) and Johnson. And then Johnson got the job for Marco Simone outside Rome.\n\nAnd on it went, the home side winning each time.\n\nIn some respects, Bradley broke the mold. He hasn\'t been involved in a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup since 2014, except for being part of the Netflix docuseries that filmed him getting the awkward call from Johnson that he would not be a captain\'s pick.\n\nRory McIlroy is a keen observer of all things Ryder Cup and was surprised by Bradley choice, like so many others.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"I think Keegan was probably in disbelief, at some point, too," McIlroy said with a smile. "But certainly an interesting pick."\n\nWhen asked whether he felt it was it was a departure from what the Ryder Cup task force set out to do in 2014, McIlroy couldn\'t say except to note that players still had a voice. Thomas, Johnson and Jordan Spieth are on the committee.\n\n"It seems quite reactionary in terms of what happened in Rome," McIlroy said, referring to the Americans losing a seventh consecutive road match.\n\nMost surprising about the selection was that Bradley says he was never interviewed. The first phone call was to offer him the job. Thomas said he played a practice round with Bradley before that phone call and found it "difficult to act normal."\n\nOther names kicked around if Woods wasn\'t interested included Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar. Both had been assistants. That was template.\n\n"I don\'t think anyone is ever an obvious choice, especially going outside the box," Thomas said. "It was very apparent that it wasn\'t an obvious choice in the beginning. I think after everybody got together and talked about it, all of the light bulbs flicked off for all of us at the right time.\n\n"Once that was the thought, there was no other way."\n\nBradley will be 39 next year when the 2025 matches take place at Bethpage Black, making him the youngest captain since Arnold Palmer was 34 and a playing captain in 1963 at East Lake. He was the last playing captain in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBradley also is No. 19 in the world and said flatly he wants to play on the next team if he were to qualify.\n\nThat hasn\'t been a serious consideration for the Ryder Cup since Tom Kite was captain in 1997, the year he was runner-up (by 12 shots) to Woods at the Masters. Kite finished 35th on the PGA Tour money list that year.\n\nWoods was a playing captain at the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne in 2019. He went 3-0, though the Presidents Cup is not in the same league as the Ryder Cup in attention, promotion or the level of external pressure.\n\nAny American team in golf is tough to make these days. Bradley still is a long way off regardless of his world ranking. Thomas thinks it could happen because the U.S. hired former caddie John Wood as team manager to help with the details.\n\nMcIlroy said his name was kicked around for the 2027 matches in Adare Manor in Ireland, especially if Woods is the U.S. captain. Imagine how much hype a Woods-McIlroy captaincy would create.\n\nEven as a fantasy idea, however, McIlroy wasn\'t buying.\n\n"It\'s been mentioned and I\'ve said, \'No way.\' There\'s no way," he said. "If you want to be the best captain you can be, you can\'t play. And if you want to be the best player you can be, you can\'t captain. It\'s one or the other, especially with how big the Ryder Cup has become."\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'wcfcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'seth_wenig@wcfcourier.com', 'name': 'Seth Wenig', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wcfcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/d7/1d7f17d6-943c-53a5-b9ad-ec75ad352987/6691a6817f11c.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9727963', 'sentiment': 0.04313725490196085, 'wgt': 458519013, 'relevance': 51}

That was part of the template that came out of the task force. Future captains would first be groomed as assistants. Captains would stay on as an assistant at the following Ryder Cup. Everyone would be on the same page.\n\nIt\'s what led Phil Mickelson to declare in early 2015 after the task force came up with the plan, "I\'m excited about where we are now, and I\'m excited about where we are headed -- not just into 2016, but really for the next 10 or 20 years."\n\nPeople are also reading...

It\'s like, \'Look, who\'s our best captain right now?\'\n\n"It doesn\'t matter what they\'ve done," he said. "Are the guys going to be excited to play for him? Is he going to mesh with everybody? That\'s all that matters. That\'s something that potentially is the hope going forward.

Furyk was the next captain for 2018 in France. His assistants included Stricker, Woods and Zach Johnson. Then it was Stricker\'s turn in Wisconsin. Furyk was an assistant, along with Love (again) and Johnson. And then Johnson got the job for Marco Simone outside Rome.\n\nAnd on it went, the home side winning each time.\n\nIn some respects, Bradley broke the mold. He hasn\'t been involved in a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup since 2014, except for being part of the Netflix docuseries that filmed him getting the awkward call from Johnson that he would not be a captain\'s pick.\n\nRory McIlroy is a keen observer of all things Ryder Cup and was surprised by Bradley choice, like so many others.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"I think Keegan was probably in disbelief, at some point, too," McIlroy said with a smile. "But certainly an interesting pick."\n\nWhen asked whether he felt it was it was a departure from what the Ryder Cup task force set out to do in 2014, McIlroy couldn\'t say except to note that players still had a voice. Thomas, Johnson and Jordan Spieth are on the committee.\n\n"It seems quite reactionary in terms of what happened in Rome," McIlroy said, referring to the Americans losing a seventh consecutive road match.\n\nMost surprising about the selection was that Bradley says he was never interviewed. The first phone call was to offer him the job. Thomas said he played a practice round with Bradley before that phone call and found it "difficult to act normal."\n\nOther names kicked around if Woods wasn\'t interested included Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar. Both had been assistants. That was template.\n\n"I don\'t think anyone is ever an obvious choice, especially going outside the box," Thomas said. "It was very apparent that it wasn\'t an obvious choice in the beginning. I think after everybody got together and talked about it, all of the light bulbs flicked off for all of us at the right time.\n\n"Once that was the thought, there was no other way."\n\nBradley will be 39 next year when the 2025 matches take place at Bethpage Black, making him the youngest captain since Arnold Palmer was 34 and a playing captain in 1963 at East Lake. He was the last playing captain in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBradley also is No. 19 in the world and said flatly he wants to play on the next team if he were to qualify.\n\nThat hasn\'t been a serious consideration for the Ryder Cup since Tom Kite was captain in 1997, the year he was runner-up (by 12 shots) to Woods at the Masters. Kite finished 35th on the PGA Tour money list that year.\n\nWoods was a playing captain at the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne in 2019. He went 3-0, though the Presidents Cup is not in the same league as the Ryder Cup in attention, promotion or the level of external pressure.\n\nAny American team in golf is tough to make these days. Bradley still is a long way off regardless of his world ranking. Thomas thinks it could happen because the U.S. hired former caddie John Wood as team manager to help with the details.\n\nMcIlroy said his name was kicked around for the 2027 matches in Adare Manor in Ireland, especially if Woods is the U.S. captain. Imagine how much hype a Woods-McIlroy captaincy would create.\n\nEven as a fantasy idea, however, McIlroy wasn\'t buying.\n\n"It\'s been mentioned and I\'ve said, \'No way.\' There\'s no way," he said. "If you want to be the best captain you can be, you can\'t play. And if you want to be the best player you can be, you can\'t captain.

If his three assists before the semifinals hinted at his undoubted promise, Yamal\'s spectacular curling shot that propelled Spain to a 2-1 win over France in the last four signaled a new star had arrived.\n\n"He\'s a generational talent," England striker Ollie Watkins said Friday of Yamal. "He has got the world at his feet."\n\nWhile Yamal and fellow winger Nico Williams now offer their national team a hitherto-lacking directness out wide, it\'s the central midfield that has given Spain the edge over all of its rivals.\n\nRodri, perhaps pound-for-pound the world\'s most effective player, and Fabian Ruiz are the axis from which Spain thrives. Dani Olmo has joined them as the most attacking of pretty much a complete central-midfield three that England will struggle to contain.\n\nSpain topped a group containing defending champion Italy and 2022 World Cup semifinalist Croatia, before eliminating host nation Germany and Mbappé\'s France, for many the pre-tournament favorite.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt\'s six straight wins for La Roja. No wonder they are being so heavily backed ahead of the final.\n\n"They have been the best team," England coach Gareth Southgate said of Spain. "... but we are there and from what we have shown to this point, we have as good a chance as they do."\n\nIndeed, Spain should not underestimate England, whose tenacity and character have stood out way above its quality of play at Euro 2024. The nation\'s most talented squad for 20 years has underperformed, looking unbalanced, short of ideas and in some cases fatigued, but has somehow scrapped through to a second straight European Championship final.\n\nThree years ago, England lost to Italy in a penalty shootout on home soil at Wembley Stadium, extending the birthplace of soccer\'s painful wait for a major men\'s title since its one and only at the 1966 World Cup.\n\nSouthgate\'s team is back in the title match -- its first ever outside England -- and is an increasingly confident underdog, with potential matchwinners dotted throughout the team in Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka and Kane. Someone has always popped up with a crucial goal -- Bellingham with the stoppage-time equalizer against Slovakia in the last 16, Saka with the 80th-minute equalizer against Switzerland in the quarterfinals, even backup striker Watkins pretty much exactly on 90 minutes against the Netherlands in the semifinals.\n\nWho will come to Southgate\'s rescue on Sunday -- if indeed someone does?\n\n"They are able to inflict a lot of damage, even without playing in a very fluid way," Spain defender Dani Vivian said. "But they have that quality that makes them able to produce those sparks."\n\nThe smart money, though, is on Spain winning a seventh straight game to clinch a record fourth European Championship title.\n\nIt would be a just end to a tournament where few teams really clicked apart from the Spanish, who have dovetailed a more ruthless attacking edge with their longstanding possession game that perhaps peaked in the Euro 2012 final when a team of midfielders -- notably Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Xabi Alonso and David Silva -- ran over Italy in Spain\'s 4-0 win.\n\nThe class of 2024 might not have those names, but they\'d be worthy successors.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'lacrossetribune.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'La Crosse Tribune'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@lacrossetribune.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/lacrossetribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/e5/6e5f7d20-8071-5f35-9e0f-393cdc39415d/6691a4f96e292.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9729240', 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 458518856, 'relevance': 26}

That population is just over 33,000 people. For reference in Michigan, that\'s about the size of Eastpointe.\n\nSan Marino sent five athletes to the last summer Olympics in Tokyo, and incredibly, three of them brought home medals, including wrestler Myles Amine.\n\n"We have really a melting pot of nationalities, ethnicities in my family, but the one thing that remains common is our love for wrestling," said Amine.\n\nAmine grew up in Brighton. He won two wrestling state championships in high school, then went on to a standout career at the University of Michigan.\n\nBut when it came time for the Olympics, Amine realized his dual citizenship presented a unique opportunity.\n\n"My great-grandfather came over from San Marino back in the day, and he kept his Sammarinese citizenship. And that\'s something that is passed down through lineage. So my mother actually passed her Sammarinese citizenship down to me," said Amine. "I thought it\'d be a really cool opportunity. It would give me the best opportunity to compete in the Olympic games, travel the world, and then, most importantly, to represent this really small country that I\'m sure a lot of people listening haven\'t even (heard of), are gonna end up Googling."\n\nIn Tokyo, Amine was honored to be selected as one of San Marino\'s flag bearers for the Opening Ceremony.\n\n"It was myself and a swimmer, Arianna, and we both walked in, and we kind of looked at each other, and we both had the same look in our eyes, of like, \'This is happening right now,\'" said Amine. "That was one of those moments where I was like, \'Let\'s just take this in and smell the roses a little bit.\' You know, the competition and all that stuff is going to come, but this is definitely what they mean when they say, live in the moment."\n\nWhile Amine represents his mother\'s side of the family in competition, he is carrying on an Olympic legacy from his father\'s side.\n\nHis grandfather Nazem Amine competed in the 1952 and 1960 Olympics for the country of Lebanon.\n\n"He deserves all the credit for, you know, me getting into wrestling, my father, my uncle, all my cousins. We wouldn\'t be where we were if it wasn\'t for his legacy."\n\nMyles\' older brother Malik Amine also wrestled for San Marino.\n\nSo how much do the Amines love wrestling? Myles\' dad Mike turned their basement into a wrestling room.\n\n"At first I think, I think my mom was, like, thinking he was crazy, but then even she realized that it was a perfect place to send us down to when we started to get rough," laughed Amine.\n\nThe investment has certainly paid off. Myles Amine won a bronze medal in Tokyo.\n\nBut with COVID restrictions, something was missing.\n\n"I won a bronze medal, and you could kind of hear, like a few cheers, but then there was also like crickets in the background," said Amine.\n\nThis time, the stands will be filled with "Team Amine."\n\n"I think anywhere between, like 20 to 30 people," said Amine. "The first day after the world championships, when I qualified, they were already looking at hotels and Airbnbs and trying to buy up allotments of tickets."\n\nFor the Amine family, it\'s already a dream come true.\n\n"I\'m on cloud nine, we are super pumped and excited," said Mike Amine. "Obviously, we all want him to win, but the journey\'s been incredible for the Amine family, the University of Michigan, his extended family, the fans. I think proud is just an understatement."\n\nMyles Amine is proud of everything he\'s accomplished so far, but don\'t expect to see his Olympic medal on display.\n\n"My coach, he, like, he won two Olympic gold medals, and he said the first thing he did was put them away in like a sock drawer when he won them, because he was like, \'It\'s on to the next,\' and so I\'ve tried to share that mentality," explained Amine. "Until I retire, I think that all the medals and stuff, there\'s not going to be a showcase for them, because it kind of defeats the purpose of why I\'m doing this."\n\nAmine said he\'s discovered for him, the joy is in the journey.\n\nAnd this journey isn\'t over yet.', 'source': {'uri': 'clickondetroit.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'WDIV'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'sarah_mayberry@clickondetroit.com', 'name': 'Sarah Mayberry', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/anyclip/U5LrqJABTuwtjANW0jw-/1720821153650_1920x1080_thumbnail.jpg?_a=DATAdtfiZAA0', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2784313725490195, 'wgt': 458518367, 'relevance': 51}

Fulton won the state championship last season.\n\nTIM HAYES Bristol Herald Courier\n\nIn an era where keyboard warriors and social media contrarians can make their unsolicited opinions on sports known with one simple click, it can be hard to reach common ground in terms of evaluating an athlete.\n\nYet, it seems on a local level there is one opinion unanimously shared.\n\nTennessee High\'s Colin Brown can flat out play some basketball.\n\nThe 6-foot-1 rising senior rose to great heights back in the winter for the Vikings and the sentiments about his skills from folks who know a thing or two about quality hoopsters are similar.\n\n"Colin Brown controls the game on both ends of the floor," said West Ridge coach John Dyer. "His explosiveness allows him to get to the basket for his own shot or he is able to create a shot for his teammates. He has great instincts on defense that disrupts offenses with steals and deflections. He is the attacker for 32 minutes."\n\nPeople are also reading...

He knows the game, so anything you try to throw at him, he\'s prepared for. Just a great all-around player. ... Great kid with a great future."\n\nAbingdon coach Chris Hutton, a Tennessee High graduate, offered this review: "Colin is an excellent point guard who can score and get everyone involved on the floor. He has a swag about him that brings excitement to the crowd. His deep 3s are impressive, but his mentality of getting to the rim makes him special. I have said in the past, besides my players at Abingdon, Colin is my favorite player in this area to watch."\n\nLucas Honeycutt, leader of the Elizabethton Cyclones, added his assessment: "Smooth, confident and collected. Makes everyone around him better. He\'s a great player with a ton of upside to fill out his frame for the next level."\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the game-changer earning such praise was selected as the Bristol Herald Courier\'s boys basketball player of the year for the 2023-24 season as Brown averaged 21 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals per game for a team that finished as TSSAA Region 1-AAA runner-up.\n\n"Colin had a special season," said Tennessee High coach Michael McMeans.\n\nThe most special moment came on a Saturday night in February at Viking Hall as Tennessee High hosted Grainger in the first round of the regional tourney.\n\n"Obviously, I knew I had to have a good game, because it was win-or-go-home," Brown said. "I was coming off a rough game in the district championship [in a loss to David Crockett], so I knew I had to come to play."\n\nBoy, did he ever.\n\nBy the time it was all said and done he had scored a single-game program record 54 points as his team rolled to an 86-52 victory.\n\nHe broke the previous mark of 50 points established by Hugh McMurray 30 years earlier.\n\nBrown had 23 points at halftime and 39 points entering the fourth quarter.\n\nIn two of the four periods he didn\'t miss a shot.\n\nBrown\'s final line: 20-for-26 from the field - including 8-for-11 from 3-point range - and 6-for-7 from the free throw line.\n\n"He was so hot and could do anything he wanted to do," McMeans said. "But he did it within the flow of the game. I would call a play and he would run it and the ball just found him and he knocked down the open shot. He could have just come down and went one-on-one as hot as he was, and that would have worked, but he kept his teammates involved, worked hard on defense and just let the game come to him."\n\nDerrick Hord, Marc Campbell, De\'Shaud Johnson, Charlie Nickels, Buddy Saunders, Gary "Two" Morton, Kevin Springs, Derek Linkous, Chase Branscomb, Michael Mays (Brown\'s cousin who later starred at King University and is playing professionally overseas) are just a few of the many hoops heroes who have worn a THS jersey and none of them have had a night like the one Brown did five months ago.\n\n"The play I remember most from that game was the play where I broke the record," Brown said. "When I came off the high ball screen and hit the pull-up 3 on the wing."\n\nA few days later Brown had 23 points and converted the go-ahead bucket with 18.6 seconds remaining as the Vikings rallied for a 57-56 win over Greeneville to clinch their first sectional (or sub-state as most people call it) berth since 2005.\n\n"The win against Greeneville was huge for us," Brown said. "They were the higher seed and we played at Claiborne County, which we had never played there and they had, so we were at a big disadvantage I thought. We came out a little slow, especially me and we get to halftime down seven points. We come out [in the second half] playing really well and brought it close going into the fourth and closed it out."\n\nWhile Tennessee High dropped its final two games - Brown had 22 points in a loss to Crockett in the regional finals and 15 points in a 71-42 setback to eventual state champ Fulton in the sub-state showdown - it was still a successful season.\n\nDon\'t let that 18-17 record fool you.\n\nNot many people predicted the Vikings to reach that point after several standouts graduated and the team began the season by losing five of its first six games.\n\n"This season was a roller-coaster is the only way to describe it," Brown said. "We started off the season a little rough, just because it was a new team, but as the year went on, we bonded and built chemistry. We started to get it together and win games and getting to sub-state, but we didn\'t get to the goal of going to state."\n\nCreed Musick was the 2022-23 Bristol Herald Courier\'s player of the year after a stellar senior year as the go-to guy for the Vikings and Brown took over his role as the catalyst.\n\n"The biggest thing that I learned from Creed was just playing every play at 100 percent and good things will happen," Brown said. "Whether that\'s offense or defense and he taught me how to lead the team and keep everything under control."\n\nBrown was one of those players who opponents and spectators alike knew was going to get the ball and could still score at will.\n\n"I knew people were going to guard me very hard and I was going to have to just deal with it," Brown said. "I\'m not the most athletic, but I used my change of pace and just had to be smarter than the person guarding me by drawing a foul and picking and choosing my spots on the floor where I was going to score."\n\nThat comes from years of practice.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\n"I started playing basketball since I was around 5 or 6," Brown said. "The thing I remember the most was being the smallest kid on the court, so I always had to find different ways to score the ball and be effective and I think that helped me a lot."\n\nBrown got better as the season went along as did the Vikings.\n\n"The biggest thing was confidence," Brown said. "Because my sophomore year I was the third or fourth option, so the offense and defense was not as reliant on me, so I didn\'t have to be as confident, but this year I just told myself no matter who we played that I was the best player on the court and just had to show up every night."\n\nHe sure did and his arsenal was full of impressive moves.\n\n"Nobody can stay in front of Colin he is so quick," McMeans said. "His first step and the way he sets his defender up are really something that is special," McMeans said. "Colin was able to continue to score and perform at a high level even when teams ran junk defenses against him because of his willingness to play within our offense. We move Colin around a lot. Sometimes we start him bringing the ball up, sometimes off the ball. We may start him the corner on the wing or at the high post. So, the other teams just can\'t prepare for him always having the ball in his hands. Colin got really good at coming off screens and setting his defender up, which allowed him to be the special playmaker that he is."\n\nHe also had that clutch gene that can be hard to find in some teenage talents.\n\n"There are not many players in the entire state who can take a game over like he does, no matter what defense is thrown at him," McMeans said. "The great thing about it is there is no panic at all in him. When the other team runs a different defense at him, he just normally looks over at me and we get him lined up and have a play we can run to get him open. Some kids tend to panic if they get double-teamed, face guarded or junk defended. Not Colin."\n\nWhile Brown is a volume scorer, he is not some shameless gun firing up low-percentage shots in a detrimental way.\n\n"The most underrated thing about Colin is his willingness to make his teammates successful," McMeans said. "He really cares about his teammates and enjoys when they are successful. He is so unselfish and is all about our team winning."\n\nColin Brown has a valuable mentor in older brother Brandon Brown, who was a high school star and began his collegiate career at Lees-McRae.\n\n"He has been a huge help and not just helping me get better skill-wise, but mentally as well," Brown said. "Just keeping myself in the game when I\'m missing shots or not playing well. He has also taught me a lot about the game and the right way to play it."\n\nKing University, Lees-McRae and Milligan have extended scholarship offers, while NCAA Division I programs such as East Tennessee State University, Radford, North Carolina-Asheville and Western Carolina have expressed interest in securing Colin Brown\'s services.\n\nBrandon Brown transferred from Tennessee High to Teays Valley Christian in West Virginia during his high school career, but Colin Brown will not be taking a similar path.\n\n"I mean yeah, I have thought about it a lot since my sophomore year and have talked to a lot of prep schools around the country," Brown said. "But I think that is best for me to stick to what is working and not have to basically start over somewhere else, so I will be playing my senior year at THS."\n\nThat\'s probably not news area coaches were hoping to hear.\n\nThey are likely already trying to think of gameplans to slow Tennessee High\'s scoring machine.\n\nGood luck.\n\n*\n\nAll-BHC Boys Basketball Team\n\nPlayer of Year: Colin Brown (Tennessee High)\n\nCoach of Year: Julius Gallishaw (Virginia High)\n\nFirst Team\n\nColin Brown, Tennessee High\n\nKeyton Keene, Honaker\n\nReed Kirtner, George Wythe\n\nDeonte Mozell, Virginia High\n\nMarkelle Ray, Graham\n\nSecond Team\n\nKory Bostic, Union\n\nCade Caywood, Patrick Henry\n\nGunner Garrett, Gate City\n\nMike Reece, Lebanon\n\nCorbin Laisure, Sullivan East\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'heraldcourier.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HeraldCourier.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/21/b211131e-4070-11ef-adea-dbf1c86421c6/66919d524a397.preview.jpg?crop=1175%2C617%2C0%2C573&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2156862745098038, 'wgt': 458518191, 'relevance': 26}

"This tree stump was huge. I sort of smoothed it out, used my skills to fix it all up. I put some soil in, put some plants."\n\nThe landscaper, who grew up in nearby Mentone, said he was "passionate about the area" and wanted to help clean it up.\n\n"Driving around you see rubbish everywhere," he said. "I\'m just sorting out my little patch. It\'s that broken windows philosophy -- cleaning up rubbish and needles, making it look normal, it deters people dumping stuff."\n\nBut to his surprise, Mr Marsal was contacted by Frankston City Council officers earlier this year requesting he come to discuss the unauthorised works, after a tip-off by another local.\n\nMr Marsal said he thought he was "just going in to have a conversation", but instead was subjected to an extraordinary police-style interrogation by Bruce Gardiner, the council\'s prosecutions co-ordinator.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 20-minute grilling, described as "disturbing" by a local MP, Mr Marsal was "already on the defensive" after what he alleges was Mr Gardiner\'s "rude and arrogant" treatment of him on the phone.\n\nMr Gardiner -- who made headlines last year after pop star Tones and I and her husband were slapped with $25,000 in fines for illegal renovations to their Frankston investment property -- opens the on-camera interview by telling Mr Marsal he was going to ask about "some allegations about the illegal deposit of litter on the side of the road".\n\n"I don\'t know that it\'s litter, but OK," Mr Marsal says.\n\nMr Gardiner proceeds to read Mr Marsal his rights and requests he state his full name, sparking a hostile back-and-forth that sets the tone for the remainder of the combative interview.\n\n"There\'s probably a lot of Adam Marsals in the world," Mr Gardiner says.\n\n"No not really, if you want to do a Google search," Mr Marsal says.\n\n"Do you want to state your full name or not?" Mr Gardiner says.\n\n"I\'ll just say Adam Marsal," Mr Marsal says.\n\n"Do you want to state your full name or not?" Mr Gardiner says.\n\nMr Gardiner bristles when Mr Marsal similarly refuses to give his age and date of birth, or answer questions about his business, saying he doesn\'t "see how that\'s relevant".\n\n"Well answer my questions or don\'t answer my questions, let me work out what\'s relevant and what\'s not, OK?" Mr Gardiner says.\n\nLater in the interview Mr Gardiner produces a series of photos of the hole.\n\n"Yeah I\'ve cleaned up the site, it used to be a f**king derelict site, full of s**t," Mr Marsal says angrily. "Mind you, there was this big gum tree, it fell over and you left a hole in the ground two metres deep and about four metres wide, right here, for about six months, so I cleaned it up."\n\n"You work for the council -- the council left the hole in the ground," Mr Marsal says.\n\n"Adam, why did you put those items on the side of the road?" Mr Gardiner says.\n\n"I\'ve just been telling you," Mr Marsal says. "Did you hear what I\'ve been talking about. Does that answer your question?"\n\n"No it doesn\'t," Mr Gardiner says. "Your suggestion is that you put those items there to beautify the area."\n\nHe tells Mr Marsal council has no record of him having reported the hole.\n\nMr Marsal insists "I called you guys, I called VicRoads, I cleaned it up because no one was coming".\n\n"This is my home, I live across the road from this place," he says. "I\'ve spent thousands of dollars buying stuff for this."\n\nMr Gardiner informs him that to do works in a road reserve he needs a permit, which Mr Marsal concedes he does not have.\n\nLast month, Mr Marsal received two infringement notices -- one to himself and one to his company -- for "depositing waste of more than 1000 litres" in violation of the Environment Protection Act 2017, totalling $11,500.\n\nAfter his story was featured on Nine\'s A Current Affair earlier this week, Mr Marsal then received another letter from council requesting access to his property for a building inspection on Monday, July 15.\n\n"Frankston City Council has received information that there is potentially unsafe or non-compliant building work at the abovementioned property that requires inspection," the letter said.\n\nnews.com.au does not suggest that Mr Gardiner had any involvement in the issuing of the letter.\n\nMr Marsal said he had owned his two-bedroom freestanding unit for nearly 10 years.\n\n"Years ago I did some renovations inside and landscaped it, put retaining walls up, fixed the veranda that was falling down and put in some stairs," he said.\n\n"That\'s the extent of it. It\'s been like that for years, and coincidentally after the other issue they sent [this letter]. It makes me feel intimidated and harassed. I\'m pretty sure they can go to any house in Australia and pick someone up on anything."\n\nMr Marsal said he did not intend to give consent to the search, meaning the council "have the option to go to a magistrate and get a search warrant".\n\n"I\'m not a murderer, I\'m not a drug dealer," he said. "I try to keep my head down in life, I don\'t want these kinds of issues. You just don\'t go and treat people like this."\n\nPaul Edbrooke, the Labor state MP for Frankston, said watching how Mr Marsal was treated in the video "was actually quite disturbing".\n\n"These kinds of issues can be treated in a much more pragmatic and productive manner," he said. "In the last few months we\'ve had quite a few complaints in regards to the way ratepayers are being treated by council over issues such as this one. Personally I have no idea why council would be this heavy-handed on someone that basically did their job for them."\n\nMr Edbrooke said he had "no idea at all why you would treat anyone in your community like that". "The effect on Adam\'s small business is just amazing and very, very disruptive," he said.\n\nThe MP also said he found the timing of the letter "really suspicious".\n\n"A reasonable person could start thinking that this is targeting, intimidating and bullying someone," he said.\n\n"This council has been pulled up quite a few times for alleged bullying. I think there is some big cultural issue."\n\nMr Edbrooke said "overall the message I\'ve gotten" from constituents was the council was "out of touch, out of focus and they\'ve got a culture problem".\n\n"People are just wondering, when the rates, roads and rubbish portion of their council rates, they don\'t get those services, why council are focusing on these other pet projects they\'ve got," he said.\n\n"Meanwhile a hole that had been there more than six months, two metres deep, a guy that has to take matters into his own hands is then charged $11,500."\n\nAdam Glezer from Consumer Champion, who is representing Mr Marsal, said he had "seen council issues but nothing nearly as disgraceful as this situation".\n\n"It seems like a classic case of bullying," he said.\n\n"The tactics that the council used in this situation were extremely inappropriate."\n\nMr Glezer said from what he had heard, "this is a systemic problem with Frankston City Council".\n\n"How can you give a good Samaritan a $11,500 fine for making an area safe that the council failed to do themselves?" he said.\n\n"Adam went in for a meeting with his local city council, not the AFP. That\'s exactly how they came across."\n\nHe added that "rather than apologising for their egregious behaviour, the council has doubled down".\n\n"He\'s done nothing different to his house in several years, yet the council thought it was appropriate to send him [an inspection] letter shortly after I got involved in his case," he said.\n\n"Frankston City Council representatives need to have a good, hard look at themselves because they are an absolute embarrassment. It appears they couldn\'t care less about their community."\n\nLate on Friday, after news.com.au sent questions to Frankston City Council, Mr Marsal said he received an email informing him Monday\'s inspection would not go ahead.', 'source': {'uri': 'news.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'News.com.au'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'frank_chung@news.com.au', 'name': 'Frank Chung', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4517712ee28bead48aed2c89dce9ebd1', 'eventUri': 'eng-9729747', 'sentiment': -0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 458517576, 'relevance': 29}

Bynum said Friday.\n\nC.L. Daniel, a Georgia native whose name had never before come to the attention of Race Massacre researchers, is the first person identified through a project launched five years ago by Mayor G.T. Bynum to find unmarked burials from the May 31-June 1 calamity in which more than 35 square blocks of Tulsa\'s Black Greenwood District were destroyed by whites and dozens and perhaps hundreds of people were killed.\n\nDNA comparisons, genealogical research and two letters in the National Archives led Intermountain Forensics, a firm working with the city, to Daniel. The DNA and genealogy narrowed the search to two brothers with that last name.\n\nOne of the letters, a 1936 missive from a Georgia attorney to the U.S. Veterans Administration on behalf of Daniel\'s mother, identified C.L. as almost certainly the occupant of what archeologists denote as Burial #3 in the old Black paupers\' section of Oaklawn.\n\nThe letter, from Stanford Arnold of Newnan, Georgia, on behalf of Amanda Daniel, seeks "any benefits that be due her" because of her son\'s service and honorable discharge because of injury.\n\n"She has no discharge (papers) and is going to have difficulty in establishing his death," Arnold wrote. "C.L. was killed in a race riot in Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921 according to best information she has furnished me."\n\nIt is unclear whether the VA responded or if Amanda Daniel, who the lawyer described as "in destitute circumstances," received any assistance.\n\nThe National Archives search also produced a letter written by C.L. Daniel, apparently to the Army, in February 1921 from Ogden, Utah. In poignant language, Daniel says his legs pain him, apparently from an injury suffered in the Army, and make finding work difficult. Daniel says he spent 19 days in the Camp Gordon, Georgia, hospital.\n\n"(F)or some time I have traveled this country over and now sufriend (suffering) with complance (complaints) that (I) was in the base hospitle (hospital) with," Daniel wrote, his spelling and grammar a testament to the sort of education many Americans and especially Black Americans received in the early 20th century. "(D)ear sir, please send me a nof (enough) money to git me a job and to eat with till I Get better."\n\nDaniel\'s burial place was among the first uncovered in 2020 by the team headed by state archeologist Kary Stackelbeck and University of Florida forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield. Its proximity to headstones of two known massacre victims, Reuben Everett and Eddie Lockard, and to an area in which other remains similarly buried, make the researchers reasonably certain they have found the "original 18" -- 18 Black massacre victims reported at the time to have been buried in Oaklawn Cemetery, but without information about their exact location -- and two sets of remains with signs of gunshot wounds.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStubblefield said a cause of death could not be determined for Daniel, whose remains were exhumed in 2021 and later reinterred in the same grave. She said it appeared the body had been scrunched into a coffin too small for him.\n\nBynum indicated Daniel\'s family, whose members were not identified, have not decided how they want to proceed with final burial.\n\n"We\'re going to work with them every step of the way," Bynum said. "Whatever they decide to do with the remains, the city of Tulsa is fully supportive of that."\n\nDaniel\'s identification accounts for one of several of Original 18 listed on death certificates as "unknown." It has also has reinvigorated the project.\n\nAt Friday\'s press conference, Bynum said the archeological team will return to Oaklawn on July 22. Stackelbeck indicated this phase will last more than a week and concentrate on the Original 18 area.\n\n"We now feel doubly confident of the criteria we\'ve been using to know which ones are good candidates for exhumation," she said.\n\nDanny Hellwig, director of Intermountain\'s Laboratory Development, said Daniel\'s identification is really the first of its kind.\n\n"This hasn\'t really been done before," Hellwig said. "We\'ve been learning through the process. As we\'ve learned and adapted, we\'re getting better at it. ... We hope this will provide some confidence and context and maybe a lot more trust so that we can expand on this."\n\nIdentification relies on voluntarily submitted DNA, public databases and families\' willingness to answer questions about relatives or ancestors.\n\nIn Daniel\'s case, researchers said, extended family members were mostly unaware of the circumstances of his death, if they knew of him at all. Intermountain\'s Alison Wilde, who handles the genealogical side, said many living family members did not know each other, much less the story of a great uncle who died without direct descendants more than a century ago.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921\n\nIn 1921, white mobs invaded Greenwood and burned it down\n\nA growing but divided city had tensions rising.

The Greenwood Massacre of 1921 has been largely ignored by history, but Pelley finds a Tulsa community seeking to shed more light on what\'s been called the worst race massacre in history," a preview reads for a "60 Minutes" story airing 6 p.m. Sunday on CBS.\n\nContext for viewers: Six airplanes circled the Greenwood area during the morning hours of June 1.\n\nWhat they were doing, and why there were so many, has long been a matter of passionate debate. Many people believe they were used to shoot at people on the ground and bomb Greenwood.\n\nOfficials said the small craft, generally thought to be two-seat, single-engine Curtis "Jenny" biplanes, were merely keeping track of activities on the ground and relaying the information through written messages dropped in weighted metal cylinders attached to streamers.\n\nTo what extent this explanation was initially challenged is unclear, but in October 1921 the Chicago Defender published a story in which it said Greenwood had been bombed under orders of "prominent city officials."\n\nThe story cited a Van B. Hurley, who the newspaper said had given a signed statement to Elisha Scott, a Kansas attorney.\n\nScott filed dozens of lawsuits on behalf of victims but doesn\'t seem to have ever entered the Hurley affidavit into the record. There is no record of a Van B. Hurley living in Tulsa around the time of the massacre or that anyone by that name ever belonged to the Tulsa police force.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean the story did not have substance. Many people believed city officials were behind the burning of Greenwood, and the explanation that the squadron of planes was only used for surveillance struck some as suspiciously thin.\n\nCertainly the planes had a great psychological impact on many. For example, Mary Jones Parrish wrote about them in her account, as did prominent attorney B.C. Franklin in his.\n\nThe Defender story said the planes dropped "nitroglycerin on buildings, setting them afire."\n\nBut nitroglycerin is an explosive, not an incendiary. It is also highly unstable and dangerous.\n\nThat has caused some to speculate that something like Molotov cocktails might have been used, or "turpentine balls" -- rags soaked in flammable liquid and wrapped around the head of a stick.\n\nThere are several practical reasons why trying to light and throw incendiary devices from an open cockpit airplane of that era would seem a difficult, dangerous and even foolish idea.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean it wasn\'t done.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre / The Tulsa World Library: See all of the coverage of the race massacre in this special report.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921', 'source': {'uri': 'muscatinejournal.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Muscatine Journal'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'tulsa_world@muscatinejournal.com', 'name': 'Tulsa World', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/muscatinejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/e1/fe1cb434-fdab-5367-b40e-18eeb3abef17/66919e3b3fc85.preview.jpg?crop=1764%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9728812', 'sentiment': -0.192156862745098, 'wgt': 458516166, 'relevance': 31}

Others posted memes and GIFs proclaiming "FINALLY!," "It\'s about time," and "continuous improvement."\n\nAnother simply conceded, "This is the OK-ish I seen her in a while..."\n\nWilliams\' famous friends may have been full of compliments as the sports phenom prepared to host ESPN\'s annual awards ceremony on Thursday night (where she donned an array of other looks), but intensive discourse over her beauty and fashion choices is ongoing. In recent months, there has been an uptick in criticism from TikTok fashion pundits and commenters, largely disparaging the tennis legend\'s personal style. Everything from her glam squad to ignorance of what works for her body or skin tone has been under indictment, with some even suggesting she is emulating a white woman. That these critiques have come almost exclusively from Black women adds a striking and nuanced layer to the conversation.\n\n"...[Me] saying that she looks a goddamn mess is not rooted in colorism and misogyny," stated TikTok user @themedusashow in a May 7 post. "While it may not be constructive, it is a valid critique."\n\nFellow influencer @politicsandfashion immediately cosigned the sentiment, saying, "[@themedusashow] just said the thing that a lot of us have been thinking and we have been unwilling to say.\n\n"At the risk of sounding like it\'s coming from a place of internalized misogynoir, I don\'t think that we hold people accountable for the teams that they have around them, because at this point, Serena Williams, you\'re choosing violence," she continued. "At this point, you are too wealthy to be choosing to look like that. I don\'t think I know a celebrity whose glam is always off like that."\n\nAs these posts and others have garnered mass consensus, it\'s fair to say the critiques struck a chord. But while the instinct may be rooted in wanting the best for our good sis Serena, is the criticism as constructive as it claims to be?\n\n"It is 100% constructive criticism from within the black female community that is coming from a good place," wrote a commenter in defense of @politicsandfashion\'s post. "They\'re not saying \'You look awful, haha\', it\'s more \'You deserve and have earned to look your most beautiful, and the team you have surrounded yourself with is letting you down\'."\n\nWhether or not Williams was listening has become the latest topic of conversation, as her recent appearances at this year\'s Essence Fest -- and now, the ESPYS -- have been met with a far more affirmative response.\n\n"It says she don\'t want to hear y\'all talk about her no more..." sang TikTokker @nowletsbeforreal on Monday against a collage of Williams\' festival looks. "We gotta give it to her, y\'all," said TikTokker @amanduuuhplease in a post titled "This is how Serena Williams always should\'ve been styled." "[Williams] went back to the drawing board, she took our notes...and she showed us."\n\nOn the surface, it\'s cute and clickable content -- but good or bad, is it really anyone\'s place to publicly police Williams\' fashion choices or looks? As this for-Black-women-by-Black-women discourse has dominated our timelines in recent days, the Black women of theGrio\'s Lifestyle team weighed in with some critiques of our own.\n\nHaniyah Philogene, Staff Writer\n\nOne of the best yet often unspoken norms of womanhood is fixing another woman\'s hair if it\'s out of place -- or signaling her to adjust her dress because her bra strap is showing. It\'s representative of what social media calls a "girl\'s girl"; in other words, a woman who looks out for and supports other women.\n\nSo, when it comes to the discourse surrounding Serena Williams, part of me believes these creators who so readily offer their critiques think they are simply looking out for Williams. Maybe the possibility of the tennis star or a member of her glam team seeing their videos and implementing some of these changes fueled them to start these discussions -- or maybe they are simply baiting the hook to see if anyone else shares their sentiments. Regardless of their intentions, these videos nevertheless feed into the unfortunate scrutiny Black women en masse face surrounding their appearance.\n\nBeing a Black woman can often feel like you\'re living under a microscope; if we\'re not being judged about our hair, we\'re being judged about our bodies, and the list goes on. Bearing that constant criticism, paired with an ever-changing landscape of trends and what\'s deemed "acceptable," it\'s almost as if Black women are constantly expected to keep up in a never-ending race. But unfortunately, keeping up with norms leaves little room to step out of the box.\n\nWhether social media has deemed a specific look a victory or a loss, Williams has already said she\'s loved all of her fashion choices over the years because they represent her self-expression.\n\n"I think being on worst-dressed lists is important," she said, per People magazine. "Fashion is a way to express yourself and express your personality and...who you are and what you are -- and sometimes it\'s the only way the world can see you is through your style. And so for me, whether it\'s the best list or the worst-dressed list, it\'s all kind of cool."\n\nUltimately, like most people, Williams is experimenting with different styles and looks. She just happens to be an award-winning athlete doing it in front of millions of people who feel entitled to broadcast their opinions about her looks. While this discourse may be intended to be constructive criticism offered with love from one Black woman to another, using a public platform to garner online consensus about another Black woman\'s looks risks doing more harm than good.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nWhether you loved her Essence Fest looks and her ESPYS glam or not, to say Williams has had consistent issues with her style is disingenuous. If you Google "Serena Williams\' style," you will find that since the start of her tennis career, she has been equally known for boundary-pushing glam on and off the court. She had all the girls wanting to put beads back in their braids in the \'90s. She rocked glorious weaves in the early aughts. She had a buss-down wavy ombre brown ponytail with her edges laid in the 2010s. In competition, she would dazzle the crowds at match after match with sleek, coordinated kits.\n\nAlongside her sister Venus, Serena\'s athletic prowess and penchant for style have earned her clothing and beauty lines, fashion campaigns and magazine covers. If not walking the runway for shows like Vogue World, the red carpet to accept a CFDA Fashion Icon Award, or co-chairing the Met Gala, she can be found in the front row during Fashion Week. This is clearly an arena she enjoys.\n\nRegardless of all of that, if you think someone consistently shows up one way, you are seeing a chosen aesthetic. Some recent critics have been correct in noting that, as a multimillionaire, Williams has access to top fashion and glam squads. So, that should then lead most to assume she is making deliberate choices -- and whether or not you like them, she does. It\'s also possible some of her detractors are working through their own limited imaginations about what a Black woman\'s fashion and style could and should look like. While it\'s true that fashion and personal style can be powerful tools when wielded correctly, ultimately, beauty is in the eye of the beholder -- or in this case, the wearer.\n\nWhy should we expect all the world\'s Black notable women to dress exactly the same, with their hair exactly the same and their glam exactly the same? While Williams may be expected to represent Black women of her complexion or with athletic body types, she shouldn\'t really have to. No one sees Reese Witherspoon and thinks, "She has got to show up better for blonde white women!" Let white people think a few famous Black people represent us. Let\'s just let famous Black women live.\n\nThere\'s not much to say that my colleagues haven\'t already, except if you\'re old enough to remember the genesis of the Williams sisters\' careers, you no doubt also recall that they have never lived up to anyone\'s expectations. They defied them. And after nearly 30 years of scrutiny and insults -- including being compared to men and monkeys -- that has largely had nothing to do with the paradigm-shifting talent she brought to the game of tennis, the truth is, Serena Williams owes us nothing. That so many of us want her to represent the way we think she should, only to critique any and every effort she makes to define her own aesthetic, ironically flies in the face of what she does represent: unparalleled greatness most of us can only dream about.\n\nAs Black women, we are not obligated or entitled to like Serena\'s personal style -- or even to champion her latest endeavors in the beauty and fashion industries. As the saying goes, everything ain\'t for everybody; similarly, every celebrity line ain\'t a winner (ahem, House of Deréon). While we can claim to have the best of intentions, when we engage in this specific discourse, what we largely ignore is that, beyond personal preferences and aesthetics, we\'re participating in a larger narrative that insists Black women can\'t afford to get it wrong. We can\'t afford to experiment or to play, or to straight up screw up sometimes. (Never mind the fact if any of us were to review a montage of our looks from the last 20 or even two years, we might find there were more misses than hits.)\n\nBut if anyone can afford to take those risks, even if they do get it "wrong" by someone else\'s measure, isn\'t it someone who has already defied the odds? Has Serena not already given us enough inspo for a lifetime?\n\nIs Serena Williams my personal fashion icon? No. She doesn\'t need to be. But just like so many of us were rooting for her on every court she stepped onto, maybe we can just support her right to play, win or lose.', 'source': {'uri': 'thegrio.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'TheGrio'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'thegrio_lifestyle@thegrio.com', 'name': 'theGrio Lifestyle', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2161691970-e1720809945779.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9720686', 'sentiment': 0.1843137254901961, 'wgt': 458513955, 'relevance': 6}

Each time she thought she was done, her teammates pulled her back in for another major tournament. After the Tokyo Olympics, they got her to commit to sticking with the team for next year\'s World Cup.\n\nThen, after that, they got her to stay an extra year for the Pan American Games, a top regional tournament that also is an Olympic qualifying tournament. The U.S. and Doyle won the gold medal to qualify for this summer\'s Paris Olympics, so Doyle decided she\'d stick around for that as well.\n\n"Excellent. Now it\'s like, \'OK, now you\'re only about 10 months out from the Olympics, you\'ve got to stick around,\'" Doyle said. "That little bit of a vicious cycle, it\'s how I stayed around. I don\'t know if it would have been any different if the Olympics actually would have been in 2020. I might have hung up the boots back in 2020. COVID has worked in mysterious ways for me."\n\nPeople are also reading...

The U.S. will later play Brazil and France in pool play before it attempts to get its first medal in rugby.\n\nHer longevity in what has historically been one of the most physically taxing sports since it was invented in the early 1800s came from a love for the sport and a willingness to adapt.\n\nRugby sevens was introduced at the 2016 Olympics in Rio and Doyle has been a fixture on the US teams for each of its appearances at the past two games. This year she\'lll be an American co-captain heading into this summer\'s games in Paris. During her 12-year international career, she\'s become a fixture for the Americans at the sevens level.\n\n"What\'s kept me in is the absolute constant challenge that it brings every single year -- especially since I\'ve been around for so long -- when you look at how much the game has evolved, how fast it has become and how much you have to think about it," Doyle said.\n\nDoyle had options to try track in college but wanted something different after being burned out from the sport. When Eastern Illinois offered a chance to play college rugby, she jumped at it.\n\n"I was like, \'Well, Mom, I\'m playing rugby,\'" Doyle said. "She was like, \'What the hell?\'"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nShe got hooked ever since her first game in college. She didn\'t fully grasp all the complicated rules, including offsides, and got a couple of penalties along with some tries -- the rugby equivalent of a touchdown in football -- during her first competitive match as a college freshman. She quickly figured out the intricacies of the game and used her speed to excel.\n\nThe rush of weaving around opponents or scurrying past opponents for a try was something she didn\'t experience as a local track star.\n\n"I just dove right into it. I really liked learning a new sport," Doyle said. "I feel like in America, there\'s not really a lot of ball-in-hand, running around people ... there\'s not really that football option for girls. So it just felt like I had unlocked this other side of me that I had never been able to express."\n\nAfter her college matches at EIU, she\'d watch as much rugby as she could to learn new types of play and strategies. Her speed got her into the door, and then on the radar of the U.S. National Team, but the knowledge she gained of the sport allowed her to stick. She now co-hosts a podcast that breaks down all levels of American rugby with longtime teammate Kristi Kirshe called "Chasing Eagles."\n\n"The more styles of play that you see, the more it kind of starts to make more sense in your head," Doyle said. "The more pictures that you can see on film, the more that you can see them in practice or in games and execute them better. That\'s mainly what I did."\n\nDoyle started with the U.S. team as a winger, a position with speed on the edge of the formation, but became a well-rounded player who\'s switched positions on multiple occasions and now plays mostly as the flyhalf in the middle of the American\'s formation calling plays and facilitating.\n\nThat versatility allowed her to build an international athletic resume that would\'ve been foreign to the teenager who tried out any sport she could in Central Illinois.\n\n"I don\'t even know if I had an Olympic dream necessarily," Doyle said. "When I was a kid, I obviously always thought those people were insanely talented and just like in awe, mainly of the gymnasts. I don\'t know if I\'ve ever thought it was actually attainable."\n\nNow she\'s a well-traveled Olympic veteran. Doyle had never been out of the country before she joined Team USA, and now she\'s gotten her passport filled from participating in multiple World Cups, Olympics and Pan American Games. She\'s been everywhere from Rio de Janeiro to Dubai and has played in major tournaments on five continents.\n\n"I\'m totally honored and blessed to have been a part of this program, and to have gone to those big stages," Doyle said. "And, it\'s also all the things that it\'s taught me about myself, and how to handle those situations and stay calm and composed."\n\nOlympic Women\'s Rugby Sevens\n\nWHEN: July 28-30\n\nWHERE: Stade de France, Paris\n\nHOW IT WORKS: Pool play begins July 28, with the U.S. opening against Japan at 9:30 a.m., then playing Brazil at 1 p.m. Pool play continues July 29, with the U.S. playing France at 8:30 a.m., then quarterfinals.

And I played well both days. So, it was really fun playing out here. Both of these courses are really tough to play, so I played pretty conservatively," said Lee, a 2024 graduate of Visions in Education University Preparatory Academy. "I\'m just trying to hit the fairways, hit the greens, two-putt for par, and just not getting greedy out there. I think that\'s a big thing. Don\'t try to go for everything. Sometimes it\'s good to just lay up and get your par."\n\nIt\'s the second straight year in which Lee, 17, has won the girls overall title.\n\n"It definitely means a lot. Coming in (Wednesday), I really wanted to win this event because I won it last year and I felt like I could do it," said Lee, who plays out of Rancho Solano Golf Course and Paradise Valley Golf Course in Fairfield.\n\nAlso playing well was Abduraup, a resident of Fresno, who will be a junior this fall at Clovis West High School. He shot a 1-under-par 71 on the South Course and a 4-over-par 75 on the North Course to win the boys overall title.\n\n"This is my first time ever winning a tournament, so it\'s just surreal. I can\'t really believe it," said Abduraup, 16, who plays out of Fort Washington Golf and Country Club. "I knew that (Wednesday) I came prepared and I was like, \'I\'m going to do my best. I\'m just going to play golf. And I\'m going to enjoy the course.\' Because it\'s a privilege playing here at Silverado.\n\n"And after carding a 71, I was like, \'I\'m ready for the North Course. And no matter what, golf is just a game,\' and that I want to enjoy my time on the course."\n\nJGANC flags were also presented to Lee and Abduraup.\n\nThe Johnny Miller "Champ" Junior Championship, a sold-out event with a waiting list, had a field of 84 players. There are divisions for boys 12-13, 14-15 and 16-18, and girls 12-13, 14-15 and 16-18.\n\nThe field included two Napa players - Jack Sennott and Jack Keller.\n\nJohnny Miller, a 25-time PGA Tour champion and World Golf Hall of Fame member, was on hand to present awards, which featured Scotty Cameron putters to the overall and top division finishers, along with plaques.\n\nThanks to the support of the Johnny Miller "Champ" Foundation, the cost is just $25 per player, an entry fee that includes two days of golf and lunch.\n\n"We look forward to it every year. We have it on our schedule every year. It sells out in less than an hour," said Shane Balfour, Executive Director of the JGANC, who is a member of the PGA of America and a Class A golf professional. "For those who do get in, it\'s a wonderful two days for them. It\'s great fun. And, of course, having Mr. Miller here to say hello and present some really nice prizes to the kids is great.\n\n"You couldn\'t ask for more, from the standpoint of enjoying the two days here. Silverado, obviously, speaks for itself with two world-class golf courses, one hosting a PGA Tour event. They get to see the golf course that they\'re going to see the Tour players play at."\n\nThe Johnny Miller Junior Golf Foundation was founded in 1993. The foundation, which promotes junior golf, was renamed the Johnny Miller "Champ" Foundation in 2015, honoring Miller\'s father, Larry Otto Miller.\n\nMiller won two majors, the 1973 U.S. Open and 1976 Open Championship. He was the PGA Tour Player of the Year in 1974. He was with NBC Sports for 29 years as the lead golf analyst, retiring in 2019.\n\n"That\'s the idea of the foundation - that we\'re able to get all sorts of kids into playing golf," said Miller\'s son, Andy Miller, a Justin-Siena High graduate and a four-time NCAA All-American in college at BYU. Andy also played on the PGA Tour and is in the BYU Hall of Fame.\n\n"It\'s done so much for me and so much for my dad. We\'re just doing our best to try to give back and give other people that same opportunity - if they want to play golf, that it\'s there. We offer scholarships for lessons. Thanks to so many generous donors, we have the ability to give these boys and girls an opportunity to play one of the best courses in the world.\n\n"We\'re just trying to promote junior golf in Napa anyway we can."\n\nJohnny Miller is a former co-owner at Silverado and has been a sponsor of junior golf for many years in Northern California.\n\n"I loved junior golf, and that\'s why we have our foundation, to help junior golf and also high school golf, and with my son, Andy, we\'re able to do that," said Johnny Miller, who also works as a golf course designer.

"There\'s going to be some winners. But at the end of the day, it\'s just cool to see all these kids out here playing golf. It\'s cool to give everyone that opportunity to come out here on a course the PGA Tour players play and to test their game, where the best in the world play."\n\nLee got it going early in her round, with birdies on the third, fourth and fifth holes.\n\n"I set myself up for pretty good approach shots, and I just had those numbers pretty dialed in. So, I was able to make those birdies," said Lee.\n\n"I\'ve been playing this tournament since I was 12. Ever since I was little, I was like, \'One day I want to win this tournament.\' I won it last year, and that was really exciting. So, I figured, \'OK, I won it once. I think I could do it again.\' "\n\nLee also holed out of a greenside bunker for birdie from 20 yards on the 18th hole.\n\n"I knew that I had to land it pretty softly, and it just rolled right in," she said.\n\nLee recently played in the First Tee National Championship, June 25-27, at Clemson University\'s Walker Course, in Clemson, South Carolina.\n\nLee is planning to take a gap year to focus on golf, and then will start college in 2025 at Sacramento State, as she joins in the women\'s golf team.\n\n"I just feel like this gap year is just to take the time to prepare to play on the Sac State team," she said. "Golf is a continuous process. So as a golfer, I\'m never content about where my game is at. I just feel like there\'s always that something that I need to work on."\n\nIt was Abduraup\'s first time playing Silverado\'s courses. He made sure to look at his yardage book and to be smart about his club selection.\n\n"I was thinking about what type of shot I really have to hit on this hole, what\'s the smart play, being prudent. I think that really helps with both courses because they\'re really, really challenging. It\'s all just about placement," he said.\n\nSennott was second in the boys 14-15 division, shooting 75-76 - 151.\n\n"It\'s nice to be back at home, getting back on the home track. I left a little bit out there, but it\'s always nice getting a second-place finish," said Sennott, who will be a sophomore this fall at Justin-Siena.\n\n"The greens are rolling quickly and the rough is thick. So, it was tough, and I like it that way.\n\n"It was hot weather out there. But I felt like I fought hard. I felt like I struck the ball. I think I gave it a good fight and I played well."\n\nKeller, who will be a junior in the fall at Justin-Siena, finished ninth in the boys 16-18 division, shooting 77-75 - 152.\n\nThe top finishers in each division:\n\n* Boys 16-18 division: Yasser Aziz Abduraup, 71-75 - 146; Christopher Woody, 73-74 - 147; Jacob Burnett, 72-75 - 147; Eli Slifer, 79-70 - 149.\n\n* Boys 14-15 division: Reid Bulman, 71-78 - 149; Jack Sennott, 75-76 - 151; Tyler Kalfsbeek, 76-77 - 153.\n\n* Boys 12-13 division: Stefano Castaneda, 75-85 - 160; Taejun Kim, 81-81 - 162; Kheean Nathoo, 81-82 - 163.\n\n* Girls 12-13 division: Audrey Yang, 77-81 - 158; Suri Lau, 83-78 - 161; Danica Hidayat, 80-82 - 162.\n\n* Girls 14-15 division: Giana Main, 77-77 - 154; Khloe Chao, 83-76 - 159; Lauren Lee, 77-82 - 159; Angelina Santiago, 80-79 - 159.\n\n* Girls 16-18 division: Sophia Lee, 72-72 - 144; Esther Sheu, 79-78 - 157; Hannah Stouder, 80-78 - 158.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'napavalleyregister.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Napa Valley Register'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'marty_james_napasports@napavalleyregister.com', 'name': 'Marty James Napasports', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/napavalleyregister.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/40/940b987c-4088-11ef-915e-237f5baf7627/66918df881730.image.jpg?crop=1700%2C893%2C3%2C49&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 458512160, 'relevance': 26}

"C.L. was killed in a race riot in Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921 according to best information she has furnished me."\n\nIt is unclear whether the VA responded or if Amanda Daniel, who the lawyer described as "in destitute circumstances," received any assistance.\n\nThe National Archives search also produced a letter written by C.L. Daniel, apparently to the Army, in February 1921 from Ogden, Utah. In poignant language, Daniel says his legs pain him, apparently from an injury suffered in the Army, and make finding work difficult.

She said it appeared the body had been scrunched into a coffin too small for him.\n\nBynum indicated Daniel\'s family, whose members were not identified, have not decided how they want to proceed with final burial.\n\n"We\'re going to work with them every step of the way," Bynum said.

"We\'ve been learning through the process. As we\'ve learned and adapted, we\'re getting better at it. ... We hope this will provide some confidence and context and maybe a lot more trust so that we can expand on this."\n\nIdentification relies on voluntarily submitted DNA, public databases and families\' willingness to answer questions about relatives or ancestors.\n\nIn Daniel\'s case, researchers said, extended family members were mostly unaware of the circumstances of his death, if they knew of him at all.

The Greenwood Massacre of 1921 has been largely ignored by history, but Pelley finds a Tulsa community seeking to shed more light on what\'s been called the worst race massacre in history," a preview reads for a "60 Minutes" story airing 6 p.m. Sunday on CBS.\n\nContext for viewers: Six airplanes circled the Greenwood area during the morning hours of June 1.\n\nWhat they were doing, and why there were so many, has long been a matter of passionate debate. Many people believe they were used to shoot at people on the ground and bomb Greenwood.\n\nOfficials said the small craft, generally thought to be two-seat, single-engine Curtis "Jenny" biplanes, were merely keeping track of activities on the ground and relaying the information through written messages dropped in weighted metal cylinders attached to streamers.\n\nTo what extent this explanation was initially challenged is unclear, but in October 1921 the Chicago Defender published a story in which it said Greenwood had been bombed under orders of "prominent city officials."\n\nThe story cited a Van B. Hurley, who the newspaper said had given a signed statement to Elisha Scott, a Kansas attorney.\n\nScott filed dozens of lawsuits on behalf of victims but doesn\'t seem to have ever entered the Hurley affidavit into the record. There is no record of a Van B. Hurley living in Tulsa around the time of the massacre or that anyone by that name ever belonged to the Tulsa police force.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean the story did not have substance. Many people believed city officials were behind the burning of Greenwood, and the explanation that the squadron of planes was only used for surveillance struck some as suspiciously thin.\n\nCertainly the planes had a great psychological impact on many. For example, Mary Jones Parrish wrote about them in her account, as did prominent attorney B.C. Franklin in his.\n\nThe Defender story said the planes dropped "nitroglycerin on buildings, setting them afire."\n\nBut nitroglycerin is an explosive, not an incendiary. It is also highly unstable and dangerous.\n\nThat has caused some to speculate that something like Molotov cocktails might have been used, or "turpentine balls" -- rags soaked in flammable liquid and wrapped around the head of a stick.\n\nThere are several practical reasons why trying to light and throw incendiary devices from an open cockpit airplane of that era would seem a difficult, dangerous and even foolish idea.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean it wasn\'t done.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre / The Tulsa World Library: See all of the coverage of the race massacre in this special report.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921\n\nrandy.krehbiel@tulsaworld.com\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'journalstar.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'JournalStar.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/journalstar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/c2/ac2513ba-609e-51f2-b0e7-b8488bbadec3/6691889da3fcf.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9728812', 'sentiment': -0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 458511081, 'relevance': 31}

Daniel, apparently to the Army, in February 1921 from Ogden, Utah.

"I know I speak for everyone at Intermountain Forensics, and our genealogy partners, when I say we are continually humbled by the Greenwood and Tulsa Race Massacre descendant communities, as they protect the history of, and serve as guardians of, the unknown victims of the Tulsa Race Massacre. Today the family members of Mr. C. L. Daniel join those communities. I am confident his next of kin, and the memory of their loved one, are in good hands."\n\nRecords show Daniel, a Black male in his 20s, was drafted to the U.S. Army in 1918 and discharged in December 1919. It is unclear why Daniel was in Tulsa, the team notes.\n\nDaniel\'s remains are the first from those graves to be linked directly to the massacre, in which white people killed as many as many as 300 Black people.\n\nThe massacre began when a white mob, including some deputized by authorities, looted and burned Tulsa\'s Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street. More than 1,200 homes, businesses, schools and churches were destroyed; and thousands were forced into internment camps overseen by the National Guard.\n\nOklahoma state archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck said the remains that were exhumed, including Daniel, were found in simple wooden boxes. Stackelbeck said investigators were searching for those types of caskets because they were described in newspaper articles at the time, death certificates, and funeral home records as the type used for burials of massacre victims.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre: This is what happened in Tulsa in 1921\n\nIn 1921, white mobs invaded Greenwood and burned it down\n\nA growing but divided city had tensions rising.

Bynum made the announcement Friday along with the genealogist team leader from Intermountain Forensics.\n\nThe victim in what became known as "burial 3" is World War I veteran C. L.

L.\'s family attorney written to the U.S. Veterans Administration on behalf of C. L.\'s mother regarding C. L.\'s survivor benefits."\n\nThe letter from Daniel\'s mother, noting he was killed in Tulsa in 1921, "confirms that C.

More than 1,200 homes, businesses, schools and churches were destroyed; and thousands were forced into internment camps overseen by the National Guard.\n\nOklahoma state archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck said the remains that were exhumed, including Daniel, were found in simple wooden boxes.

This is pre-release hardware as evidenced by the etchings on the rear panel used by Google to identify prototype units, though this is more final hardware given the presence of the "G" logo. A sticker/label has been attached to cover the pattern.\n\nThe comparison shows how the smaller Pixel 9 has a glossy rear panel, while the 9 Pro XL opts for a less fingerprint-prone matte finish. However, the flat side rails are reversed between the two models. As such, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a rather shiny perimeter. The difference is rather obvious and quite unfortunate.\n\nOn these units, the regulatory markings appear on the left edge near the bottom. Pixel phones in the US have gone without those markers for a few generations now (except for the Pixel Fold). It\'s unclear if this is just the design on prototype units since the itching appears on the back, or whether this is the final international look.\n\nThere\'s clearly a size difference between the (expected) 6.24-inch screen on the Pixel 9 and the 6.73-inch 9 Pro XL, but it\'s not too drastic. (The Pixel 9 Pro is rumored to come in at 6.34-inches.)\n\nA second video compares the Pixel 9 Pro XL to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, which has a 6.8-inch screen.

BMW also throws in a year's worth of public charging with Chargefox.\n\nCOMFORT\n\nThe iX3 looks, smells and feels like any other X3 inside.\n\nNicely bolstered leather-clad seats set the scene, even if it's not as spacious as some EVs.\n\nThe 510-litre boot is 40 litres down on regular X3s, but a 40/20/40 split-folding back seat makes for a flexible interior. Programmable touch pads and a smattering of physical buttons make adjusting all the major controls easy.\n\nAnd the iX3 is quiet and comfortable on the road. Suspension is firm but it suits the nature of the iX3. You'll feel the bumps but it doesn't jar or jolt.\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe iX3 has seven airbags, autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning, speed-sign recognition, blind spot-monitoring and tyre pressure monitors. Cross-traffic alert front and rear makes it easier to nudge out of parking spots and driveways.\n\nDRIVING\n\nThe iX3 delivers BMW's trademark responsiveness. Nicely weighted steering sets the scene for excellent cornering manners.\n\nWith broader rear tyres it also does a great job of getting the power to the bitumen, while the low centre of gravity adds to the planted demeanour. It all makes for a fun and engaging driving experience.\n\nThe iX3's single electric motor has a broad spread of usable grunt all the way up to freeway speeds.\n\nThe dash to 100km/h is claimed to take 6.8 seconds and there's no shortage of enthusiasm when you want to get on with things. Additional oomph in reserve makes country running a snip.\n\nFrom a standstill, there's a purposeful jolt on brisk takeoffs. It's more pronounced in Sport mode, which also stiffens the dampers. You can also engage more aggressive regenerative braking by selecting B mode on the drive selector.\n\nThe 74kWh battery is claimed to provide up to 461km of range, although closer to 400km seems realistic in everyday driving.\n\nHome charging can be done at up to 11kW for a full charge in about 7.5 hours. Faster DC charging takes about 32 minutes to juice the battery from 10 to 80 per cent.\n\nStupendous performance from two electric motors teams with a cleverly-packaged body to provide a tempting EV proposition. Minimalist cabin is not to everyone's taste but the tech and trinkets are unmatched.\n\nLexus NX450h+, from about $105,000 drive-away\n\nOne of the best plug-in hybrids in the country is currently not available to order because Lexus can't build many. Hopefully it'll be back on sale soon.\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Ultimate, from about $95,000 drive-away\n\nIt's technically a compact SUV but will suffice for many chasing a slick-driving electric SUV. Google operating tech and a lengthy equipment list add to its appeal.\n\nSharp pricing makes the EV a tempting mid-sized SUV proposition.\n\nSAFETY: 6 airbags, auto emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist, front and rear cross-traffic alert, rear auto braking, driver monitoring, speed-sign recognition", 'source': {'uri': 'couriermail.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Courier Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a2da698a5d682f9cdbcd106ef12a0efc', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.192156862745098, 'wgt': 458507767, 'relevance': 6}

The building continues to offer a glimpse of the future -- as imagined in 1971.\n\nA Google map peek inside shows a very antiquated, cramped main stage room with mirror ceilings, stiff metal chairs, some alien decor, and a neon carpet coveted by most bowling alleys.\n\nThere\'s also a charming neon sign for the bathroom that reads "The Pisser" -- right next to another "Make It Rain" one near an ATM that converts big bills into singles.\n\nThe interstellar enigma has been voted "#1 Full Nude Strip Club in Tampa Bay for 19 years running!" according to the club website, however the source of the award was unnamed.\n\nThe extraterrestrial theme has also been tried closer to home -- Long Island City-based gentlemen\'s club Gallagher\'s 2000 at one time leaned into the concept with a notorious late-night commercial involving aliens seeing all sides of our solar system.', 'source': {'uri': 'nypost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'New York Post'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-0jod0qexm-1720808198060.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1720793842&w=1024', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1215686274509804, 'wgt': 458507626, 'relevance': 26}

He said the ACC's business activities in South Carolina are prevalent enough that the conference can be sued in the state.\n\nGravely did dismiss Clemson's sovereign-immunity claim that a South Carolina public arm, such as a university, can't be sued outside the state.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The university filed a notice Thursday signaling its intention to appeal Bledsoe's decision to the North Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nFlorida State is appealing a similar Bledsoe opinion that the ACC's case against the Seminoles should remain in North Carolina. The conference preemptively sued FSU in December, one day before the university filed its complaint against the league in Florida.\n\nLeon County, Florida Circuit Court Judge John Cooper ruled last month that FSU v. ACC could be tried there.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nIn his written opinion Wednesday, Bledsoe suggested that the four actions -- Clemson v. ACC in South Carolina, Florida State v. ACC in Florida, ACC v. Clemson in North Carolina and ACC v. FSU in North Carolina -- be consolidated and heard in the Tar Heel State, home to league headquarters since its 1953 founding.\n\nHow the parties might resolve their stalemates and arrive at such a place is the great unknown, for at each procedural step, the home plaintiff has prevailed.\n\nFlorida State and Clemson are contesting the league's $130 million exit fee and grant of rights, a contract that conveys television rights to each member's home sports contests to the conference through the 2035-36 academic year. The schools want their cases tried separately in their respective home states.\n\nACC presidents and chancellors signed the league's original GOR in 2013 and an amended version in 2016, the latter document reflecting ESPN's agreement to create the ACC Network. But Clemson and Florida State, which have won a combined six national football championships, subsequently determined that the ACC's contract with ESPN, which also expires in 2036, does not pay them enough to compete with the wealthier Big Ten and SEC.\n\nTeel: Most important football season in ACC history on horizon\n\nThe schools' challenges to the grant of rights differ in that FSU seeks to invalidate the contract, while Clemson claims the grant holds only until a member departs the league.\n\nThe ACC and the University Maryland sued one another over the conference's exit fee in 2013 after the Terrapins revealed their intention to join the Big Ten. A Maryland judge deferred the matter to North Carolina, and the parties settled out of court.\n\nThe Terps paid $31.4 million, about 60% of the then-exit fee of $51.2 million.\n\nSports Week in Pictures: Wimbledon, Tour de France gain momentum\n\nDavid Teel (804) 649-6546\n\ndteel@timesdispatch.com\n\nDavid Teel\n\nSports Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow David Teel Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The lack of engagement from the community led to factions being eventually removed from the game. However, now could be a good time for Destiny 2 to reintroduce factions with fresh twists, like new allies and different activities to keep players invested.\n\nFactions were one of the most exciting things about the original Destiny, bringing the community together in a way that almost no other activity could. By pledging allegiance to a particular faction in Destiny -- Future War Cult, New Monarchy, or Dead Orbit -- players could participate in activities to increase their rank with that faction and then reap unique rewards as a result. Each faction gave players access to powerful rewards along the track to max out their rank, eventually resulting in a unique Exotic class item they could wear to show off their faction pride. However, this is largely where this story ends, as Destiny 2 attempted to implement a faction system but failed to execute it properly.\n\nDestiny 2 reintroduced factions in its first year with week-long Faction Rallies, which saw players once again pledging allegiance to either Future War Cult, New Monarchy, or Dead Orbit and then earning a major discount on a powerful weapon. Unfortunately, since each faction only offered one weapon as a reward, players would simply find out which weapon was best and pledge to the faction that offered it, thereby defeating the purpose. Destiny 2 attempted to improve factions during the Warmind DLC with better rewards, but the entire system was eventually removed from the game due to a lack of engagement from the community. Now, several years later, there might be reason enough for factions to return to Destiny 2.\n\nRelated\n\nDestiny 2 Has The Perfect Blueprint For Prismatic Changes In Each Episode\n\nDestiny 2's Revenant and Heresy Episodes could shake up Prismatic subclasses with a few targeted changes.\n\nIt's Time for Destiny 2 to Bring Back Factions\n\nClose\n\nDestiny 2 Needs Regular Content Loops Like Factions Now More Than Ever\n\nDestiny 2 is hardly ever in need of more content, as it certainly has enough to keep players busy for months on end. However, the goal should never be to keep players busy but to have a content loop that is rewarding enough to keep players coming back. In its current state, there is more than enough content to keep casual players coming back for extended periods, but Destiny 2's hardcore community arguably runs that feeling of reward dry fairly quickly and is then in need of something new. Now, the recent announcement that Destiny 2's episodic acts will no longer be time-gated is a double-edged sword, as it allows players to play at their own pace but simultaneously takes even more incentive away for players to return to the game at regular intervals.\n\nGiven the current state of Destiny 2's regular content loops, it might need something like Faction Rallies again to keep players invested. Sure, it has activities like Iron Banner and Trials of Osiris that make regular appearances, but these only appeal to a certain portion of the Destiny 2 community. Additionally, Desitny 2's limited-time seasonal events, like the Dawning and the Solstice of Heroes, have all but worn out their welcome. Factions, on the other hand, might feel fresh enough to warrant extended playtime from players, especially if they are executed well.\n\nDestiny 2 Now Has a Chance to Reimagine Factions in The Final Shape\n\nTo prevent Destiny 2's faction system from feeling too antiquated or like nothing more than recycled content, they could be reimagined in The Final Shape with the Guardians' new allies. Each of Destiny's former factions either fled the Tower or was killed off, which gives credence to new factions forming in their stead. As such, perhaps some friendly Eliksni or Cabal could represent new factions to be allied with, along with their respective weapons and armor. Commander Zavala could even represent the Guardians as a faction to complete the triangle for the ultimate rivalry.\n\nThe Destiny 2 community has reined in their expectations for factions ever returning to the game, especially now with events like Guardian Games seemingly replacing them. That being said, Bungie has consistently proven that if the cry for a particular feature is loud enough, it will listen and respond accordingly.\n\nDestiny 2\n\nBungie's Destiny 2 is an online FPS that blends single-player and multiplayer content.

They will head to the break after the three-game home series this weekend against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nEvery Friday during the regular season, Tribune baseball writers will provide an update on what happened -- and what\'s ahead -- for the Cubs and White Sox.\n\nKopech\'s immaculate moment\n\nMichael Kopech started thinking about it "from Pitch 4."\n\nPeople are also reading...

"Just glad to have a clean inning and get the win."\n\nKopech began the ninth inning facing Brooks Lee, who fouled off a fastball and a cutter. Kopech got strike three looking on a 100.1-mph fastball at the top of the zone, according to MLB Statcast.\n\nKopech got a swinging strike one on the next batter, Matt Wallner, with another fastball. Wallner fouled off a cutter, then swung and missed on a 100.5-mph fastball for strike three.\n\nMax Kepler hit for Manuel Margot. The first two pitches were cutters -- a swinging strike on the first and a called strike on the second. Kopech went back to the fastball, and Kepler couldn\'t check his swing on the 100.1-mph pitch that was out of the zone for strike three.\n\nKopech became the first Sox with a recorded immaculate inning since Hollis "Sloppy" Thurston on Aug. 22, 1923, according to statistician Christopher Kamka.\n\n"It was my first and his first (in the majors), something I\'ll always remember," catcher Korey Lee said. "Good things happen when you throw strikes."\n\nManager Pedro Grifol said the inning -- like Monday\'s 1-2-3 performance in the 10th against the Twins -- is why he never thought of moving Kopech out of the closer\'s role in the aftermath of Sunday\'s blown save against the Miami Marlins.\n\n"We\'re never going to give up on Michael, never," Grifol said. "There\'s too much talent, too much heart, too much character to even think about moving him down."\n\nCubs get No. 14 pick\n\nDays away from the first round of Major League Baseball\'s draft beginning Sunday, Cubs vice president of scouting Dan Kantrovitz and the organization are going through the final stages of lining up their draft board.\n\nBeyond a group of college hitters projected to be chosen among the top picks, Kantrovitz doesn\'t see any other demographics standing out among the class. But by drafting in the top half of the first round, the Cubs have an opportunity to find another talented player after picking left-hander Jordan Wicks, right-hander Cade Horton and infielder Matt Shaw, all out of college, the last three years.\n\n"We try to go into each draft with a blank slate," Kantrovitz said Thursday. "I think if something hadn\'t worked out with one of those picks, we wouldn\'t want it to affect our strategy in a negative way and so I think similarly, the fact that we\'ve had some positive returns so far from some recent picks, we don\'t want to really let that alter our strategy too much either. But it\'s no doubt a source of pride for our scouts and who follow these guys on a daily basis and are just so invested in every single box score."\n\nThe Cubs enter the draft with a bonus pool of $9,802,300. They have shown in the past a willingness to go under slot with certain picks and allocate those funds elsewhere in the draft.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nKantrovitz wouldn\'t tip his hand as to the direction the Cubs might go with their first pick. MLB.com\'s Jonathan Mayo has them picking East Carolina right-hander Trey Yesavage at No. 14 while The Athletic\'s Keith Law projects the Cubs to take Tennessee second baseman Christian Moore.\n\n"Our point of view on that is you don\'t want to take a step back on talent to do that," Kantrovitz said. "If you\'ve got two players that you\'re staring at your first pick and one of them will require $500,000 less than from a signing-bonus standpoint, that\'s a pretty optimal position to be in because then you can end up spreading that out throughout the rest of the draft. I think that\'s probably how most teams look at it."\n\nNumber of the week: 17\n\nWith his walk in the second inning Thursday against the Orioles, first baseman Michael Busch extended his on-base streak to 17 games, the longest by a Cub this year. He and the Atlanta Braves\' Austin Riley are tied for the longest active streak in the majors.\n\nTracking the Sox\'s record-setting losses\n\nRecord: 27-68\n\nThe Sox have the worst record after 95 games in franchise history. The previous mark of 31-64 was set in 1948.\n\nThey\'re on pace for 115 losses, five short of the record set by the expansion 1962 New York Mets. The team record is 106, set in 1970.\n\nThe team\'s 68 losses are the most for the club before the All-Star break. The previous high was 62 in 2018.\n\nCubs note\n\nAlexander Canario is getting another big-league chance, though his game opportunities may again be limited.\n\nWith outfielder Cody Bellinger landing on the 10-day injured list Thursday with a fractured left middle finger, Canario was brought up from Triple-A Iowa and again slots in as a bench option who could get spot starts against lefties.\n\n"I started going down there and working on my timing," Canario said through an interpreter. "Everything that I\'ve done throughout my career, throughout the minor leagues, I just want to come out here and just give my best and show what I\'ve got."\n\nIn 59 games with Iowa this season, Canario is hitting .238 with a .330 on-base percentage while slugging 16 home runs and 13 doubles. In limited action during his first call-up this year, Canario went 6-for-22 (.273) and posted a .360 OBP with two extra-base hits.\n\n"Just learning to make the quick adjustments from the first and second at-bats," Canario said. "Just to learn to make those adjustments as quick as possible and to go out there whenever it\'s needed."\n\nWhite Sox note\n\nThe Sox have been gearing up for the MLB draft, which begins Sunday.\n\nThey will be busy early with three of the first 68 picks -- No. 5, 43 and 68. The team\'s last top-five selection came in 2019, when the Sox drafted first baseman Andrew Vaughn at No. 3.\n\n"I think we all feel good with what\'s happening in the minor leagues," director of amateur scouting Mike Shirley said. "To add this piece of what (No.) 5 could possibly be to the next wave of this, it\'s substantial. It\'s a must."\n\nThe 20-round draft runs Sunday through Tuesday.\n\nQuotable\n\n"Every time I go out there, I\'m competing for the White Sox and trying to give us the best chance to win. I hope I give guys confidence when I step on the mound. That other stuff is there, but I can\'t do anything about it other than go out there and pitch." -- Sox pitcher Erick Fedde on trade speculation\n\nPHOTOS: Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'pantagraph.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'pantagraph.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'meghan_montemurro@pantagraph.com', 'name': 'Meghan Montemurro', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pantagraph.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/5d/85dffc40-406d-11ef-a6de-872fe075cc99/6691609c07926.preview.jpg?crop=1752%2C920%2C0%2C131&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9727892', 'sentiment': -0.08235294117647063, 'wgt': 458501006, 'relevance': 26}

"Every year, we face new challenges. But Ocean City remains the best beach in the state and a tradition for generations of families. I want to congratulate and thank the city team, our public safety departments, the Ocean City Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Tourism Development Commission, the Boardwalk and Downtown Merchants associations, local businesses, all volunteer groups and the entire community in making Ocean City a wonderful place to live, work and play."\n\nAt the music pier, Gillian accepted the win with a wave and gave the credit to the Ocean City community. He singled out the Chamber of Commerce, the president of which, Michele Gillian, is also his wife. She was in the crowd, along with most of the members of City Council.\n\nOcean City in recent years has been named "Best Beach in America" and "Best Beach" in many other statewide polls, according to a city statement. "America\'s Greatest Family Resort" also has been recognized for its Boardwalk, downtown, ecotourism, family destinations, women-owned businesses and more.\n\nPatrick Power, Margate\'s superintendent of public works, accepted the honor on behalf of his community, while Mark Virgilio represented Brigantine.\n\nRowe, who holds a doctorate in oceanography from the University of Delaware and has spent decades in marine research and education, appeared to reference a 1994 episode of "Seinfeld" in which the character George Costanza, played by Jason Alexander, impersonates a marine biologist but manages to save a distressed whale.\n\nFor much of this summer, beaches have been packed as people flee intense heat inland. The water has been exceptionally cold close to shore, but that has helped keep the heat at bay on the barrier islands.\n\nNot so much Friday, when just a few people were on the beach behind the lifeguard stand closest to the Music Pier.

Bigge gave his parents the ball after the game.\n\nHis dad, Matt, started to well up when reflecting on his son\'s first outing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

"We\'re just insanely proud. We haven\'t really stopped crying since Saturday afternoon when he got the phone call."\n\nIn the hours and days following the brightest moment of his professional baseball career, Bigge, 26, still struggled to articulate his rollercoaster journey from Harvard to the Cubs.\n\n"All this has been the weirdest, craziest three days of my life, and it all still feels like that," Bigge told the Tribune Wednesday. "But I think being able to pitch Tuesday night reminded me that I\'m still playing the same game I was playing my whole life. So I definitely just feel a little bit more settled after getting into the game."\n\nA 12th-round pick of the Cubs in 2019, Bigge methodically worked his way through the minors to reach Triple-A Iowa for the first time last year. But after 5 ½ weeks, with an 8.71 ERA and 13 walks in 10 ⅓ innings and inconsistent outings, the Cubs sent Bigge back to Double-A Tennessee where he finished the season.\n\nIt became a turning point in Bigge\'s journey. He had lost confidence and started tweaking things at Iowa, lacking conviction in his pitches. Heading into the offseason, Bigge focused a lot on the mental side of the game: being in tune with his breath and mindful in the moment.\n\n"I was really impressed with how calm he seemed," his mom, Heidi, said. "He\'s been working on the mental part and it showed Tuesday night. I mean, this is the largest crowd he\'s ever pitched in front of. It was a big moment, it was a big day and he held it together. He\'s so resilient mentally and I think that\'s just a testament to him."\n\nBigge relied on the mental work he put in during the offseason before making his debut. While warming up in the bullpen Tuesday, hyped up and sweaty in the humid, muggy weather, he struggled to throw strikes and knew that couldn\'t happen once he entered the game. Bigge refocused, relying on the breathwork he had developed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"Command has always been mental, when I feel confident in my stuff and feel confident that I can throw every pitch as hard as I can and not really care where it goes, it\'s more likely to go where I wanted to go," he said. "I\'ve always been able to strike people out, but it\'s staying in the zone and being competitive."\n\nBigge\'s triple-digit fastball understandably garners a lot of attention, but his four-pitch mix -- four-seamer, curveball, slider and sweeper -- gives the right-hander options and changes the hitters\' eye level. He loves throwing his slider, a pitch he started relying on more when he arrived at Double A in 2022. Its effectiveness has allowed Bigge to avoid being so fastball dominant, knowing he can throw his slider in any count. The Cubs helped him develop a sweeper a few years ago, which has helped him against righties by adding more horizontal movement to his repertoire.\n\nTouching 100 mph certainly adds another electric element to Bigge\'s great fastball. He credited offseason mobility work with a trainer in Arizona and learning how to use his strength and power to throw the ball harder. Bigge hit 100 mph for the first time June 15 in Columbus, Ohio, with his dad in the stands, though he initially didn\'t believe the number when he saw it on the scoreboard.\n\nMatt Bigge was seated next to Cubs prospect Owen Caissie\'s dad, who asked if Hunter had hit 100 mph before when the number appeared.\n\n"I couldn\'t speak, I just shook my head," Matt said. "But it\'s something he\'s been wanting to do for a while and he\'s flirted with it a lot over the years and he finally got it."\n\nA football injury prevented Bigge from playing his senior year at Los Gatos High School in California, so he instead lettered in swimming. When Bigge committed to play baseball and major in physics at Harvard as a two-way player, a path to the big leagues and a pro career wasn\'t at the forefront of his long-term plans.\n\nBut his performance during summer ball in the Northwoods League in 2018 quickly put him on scouts\' radar. With his appearance Tuesday, Bigge is only the fifth player drafted out of Harvard to reach MLB since 1980.\n\n"That\'s when the dream became more concrete," Bigge said.\n\nAn oblique injury he sustained in spring training prevented Bigge from joining Triple A until early June. He quickly showed he was ready for the next level by missing bats and limiting walks, something Bigge will need to continue to show Cubs manager Craig Counsell to earn opportunities out of the bullpen.\n\nBigge knows consistently throwing strikes has been an issue at times during his minor-league career, but as he proved against one of baseball\'s best lineups Tuesday, he possesses big-league stuff that could help the Cubs over the final 2 ½ months.\n\n"It\'s been really hard, it\'s been really fun at times, it\'s been a long journey," Bigge said. "There\'s been some really high highs and really low lows along the way and the past few years, I\'ve started to learn to just enjoy the experience more and just be grateful for every day that I get to play baseball."\n\nPhotos: Cubs hand the White Sox their 13th straight loss White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball White Sox Cubs Baseball Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'pantagraph.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'pantagraph.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pantagraph.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/84/f8474d04-406a-11ef-ad04-f3a2c3292d6d/66915bf730a61.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 458498924, 'relevance': 51}

Lee\'s journey as the developer of Litecoin, also known as the "silver to Bitcoin\'s gold," is a riveting story of vision, ingenuity, and perseverance.\n\nThis article looks into Charlie Lee\'s intriguing story, showcasing his accomplishments, struggles, and the most recent developments in his ongoing mission to transform digital finance.\n\nCharlie Lee was born in the Ivory Coast before moving to the United States to further his study in computer technology. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the world\'s most prominent technical schools.\n\nHis career began in the technology field, where he worked for prominent corporations such as Google on projects like Chrome OS.\n\nLee first became familiar with Bitcoin while working at Google. He became fascinated with blockchain technology after learning about its potential to disrupt existing banking systems. However, Lee recognized Bitcoin\'s limits, particularly in terms of transaction speed and scalability. He founded Litecoin with the goal of developing a more efficient alternative.\n\nCharlie Lee founded Litecoin, a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency meant to allow for immediate, near-zero-cost payments to everyone around the globe.\n\nLitecoin was a fork of the Bitcoin Core client that differed principally by having a shorter block creation period (2.5 minutes as opposed to Bitcoin\'s 10 minutes), a higher maximum quantity of coins, and a different hashing algorithm (scrypt rather than SHA-256).\n\nLee\'s ambition was to build a cryptocurrency that would complement Bitcoin by providing faster transaction times and reducing fees. This invention soon gained traction, and Litecoin rose to become one of the most prominent altcoins in the bitcoin industry.\n\nDespite their success, Litecoin and Charlie Lee encountered a number of hurdles. One major setback was the abrupt closure of LitePay in March 2018. LitePay was envisioned as a versatile payment processing option for Litecoin, which sparked widespread interest. However, its abrupt closure weakened investor trust and harmed Litecoin\'s reputation.\n\nIn August 2019, allegations surfaced claiming that the Litecoin Foundation was experiencing a financial crisis, with insufficient reserves jeopardizing its viability.\n\nLee acknowledged that the 2019 bear market had an impact on the foundation\'s reserves but reassured the neighborhood that they were running frugal operations and would be fine.\n\nFurthermore, in September 2021, erroneous rumors of a deal between Walmart and Litecoin triggered a short increase in the price of LTC. The Litecoin Foundation allegedly shared a phony press release, fueling speculation of a pump-and-dump plan. Walmart eventually issued a statement denying any involvement, which fueled the debate.\n\nCharlie Lee has continually advocated for technological advances in Litecoin. One prominent initiative is the inclusion of the MimbleWimble protocol, which aims to improve Litecoin\'s privacy and scalability. This improvement demonstrates Lee\'s dedication to Litecoin\'s continued relevance in a competitive market.\n\nLee is active in the Litecoin community. He routinely participates in debates and events, like the upcoming Litecoin Summit 2024, which brings together industry experts and community members to discuss the future of Litecoin and blockchain technology. These events offer excellent networking opportunities and insights into the latest industry advancements.\n\nCharlie Lee\'s current undertakings highlight his inventive attitude. As the third Litecoin halving approaches, he has advocated a number of projects, including the release of silver collector cards laden with \'digital silver.\' This innovative strategy not only commemorates Litecoin\'s achievements but also encourages its use and adoption.\n\nLee also participates in public discourse through interviews and social media, where he shares his perspectives on navigating the crypto market. His insights on the market\'s potential and limitations provide useful advice to both novice and experienced crypto enthusiasts.\n\nAside from his professional achievements, Charlie Lee\'s tale is one of perseverance and flexibility. His willingness to confront controversies and communicate openly with the community has gained him respect and trust.\n\nLee\'s transition from Google engineer to cryptocurrency pioneer demonstrates his vision and commitment to establishing a more efficient and accessible financial system.', 'source': {'uri': 'crypto-news-flash.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Crypto News Flash'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'muhammad_syofri_ardiyanto@crypto-news-flash.com', 'name': 'Muhammad Syofri Ardiyanto', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Charlie-Lee-Litecoin.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9727855', 'sentiment': 0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 458495239, 'relevance': 100}

The company experienced higher unit sales in the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to growth with larger customers and Onsite locations opened in the last two years. The impact of product pricing on net sales in the second quarter of 2024 was a decline of 30 to 60 basis points, in contrast to the second quarter of 2023, which experienced an increase of 190 to 220 basis points. The decline reflects lower fastener pricing, which is a by-product of lower transportation costs, as well as lower pricing in certain safety and other products categories.\n\nMoreover, the company has signed 107 new Onsite locations in the second quarter of 2024, resulting in 209 year-to-date signings of new Onsite locations. We had 1,934 active sites on June 30, 2024, which represented an increase of 11.9% from June 30, 2023. Daily sales through our Onsite locations, excluding sales transferred from branches to new Onsites, grew at a low single-digit rate in the second quarter of 2024 over the second quarter of 2023. This growth is due to contributions from Onsites activated and implemented in 2024 and 2023, which more than offset the impact of closures and a decline in revenues from Onsites activated prior to 2023. The company's goal for Onsite signings in 2024 remains between 375 to 400.\n\nFAST in the second quarter of FY 24 has reported the adjusted earnings per share of 51 cents, which met the analysts' estimates for the adjusted earnings per share of 51 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. The company had reported the adjusted revenue growth of 1.8 percent to $1.92 billion in the first quarter of FY 24, which matches the analysts' estimates for revenue of $1.92 billion. The gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 45.1% in the second quarter of 2024 from 45.5% in the second quarter of 2023. The operating income, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 20.2% in the second quarter of 2024 from 21.0% in the second quarter of 2023. The company has reported net income during the second quarter of 2024 of $292.7, a decrease of 1.8% compared to the second quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the full year of 2024, the company expects the investment in property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, to be within a range of $235.0 to $255.0, an increase from the originally anticipated range ($225.0 to $245.0) and an increase from $160.6 in 2023.", 'source': {'uri': 'fxdailyreport.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'FXDailyReport.Com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'daffa_zaky@fxdailyreport.com', 'name': 'Daffa Zaky', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/forex1.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9724473', 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 458495190, 'relevance': 54}

Few franchises have given the world as many characters to truly despise. Everyone recalls the white-hot hatred they felt the first time they saw King Joffrey\'s smug, self-satisfied smirk. House of the Dragon is no slouch in that department either. Of all the monsters in King\'s Landing, Criston Cole is probably the most detestable. His body count might not be the highest, and his sins might be behind closed doors, but it\'s hard not to want him dead. That makes his nickname, "Kingmaker," hard to hear.\n\nThe two central figures of House of the Dragon are, arguably, Rhaenyra Targaryen and Aegon II Targaryen. They\'re the two potential nobles vying for the throne. In truth, the battle tends to be between Rhaenyra and Aegon\'s mom, Alicent Hightower. Though they\'re the supposed leaders, each brings a massive ensemble of allies to the table. Some push for war, others struggle to usurp their supposed bosses, and a few express genuine loyalty. Criston Cole is a strange addition to the team, especially given his motivation.\n\nRelated\n\nHouse of the Dragon: Who is Daeron Targaryen?\n\nThe Game of Thrones prequel seems to have lost track of Viserys and Alicent\'s youngest son. Where is he, and what might he do?\n\nWhy is Criston Cole the Kingmaker?\n\nClose\n\nThe small folk of Westeros dubbed Ser Criston Cole the Kingmaker after witnessing his successful campaign across the Riverlands. Cole is one of the most warlike members of Aegon\'s entourage. He initially joins the team as Alicent\'s sworn defender. He takes that position after his brief romance with Rhaenyra falls apart. Cole is genuinely motivated, at least in part, by his teenage girlfriend\'s unwillingness to run away with him. After Rhaenyra turns him down to secure a strategic marriage, Cole whines about the supposed sullying of his position as her sworn defender. Supposedly, marrying her and subsequently stealing her away from her position as the next queen would have somehow fixed that. His incredible pettiness led him to assault a fellow knight and attempt suicide. Alicent kept him around, shifting him across the Red Keep to become her sworn protector. After Viserys died, Alicent and Cole started a torrid relationship, gradually allowing most of their other interests to fall to ruin because they just couldn\'t turn each other down. In the meantime, Cole started failing upward into increasingly important positions.\n\nCole is pretty terrible at anything that isn\'t direct physical combat. He\'s an exceptional warrior and a pretty good battlefield strategist, but his mind only seems to work when it\'s considering troop movements. His trysts with Alicent leave much of the Red Keep undefended, indirectly allowing the Blood and Cheese plot, which leaves Aegon II\'s heir dead. However, he\'s one of the few people in the castle pushing for conflict. Cole hates Rhaenyra, leading him to encourage a war for his own petty vengeance. This places him in Aegon\'s good graces, as the king despises politics. Aegon eventually fires the longtime Hand of the King, Otto Hightower, to replace him with Cole. Cole\'s harebrained schemes fell flat at first. He sends Arryk Cargyll behind enemy lines in the guise of his brother, knowing full well that the guy Arryk is impersonating will be at the scene. Cole returns to his core competencies when he and Aemond work out a plan to take the Riverlands. This campaign of violence across several small towns leaves many dead, but it also massively increases Cole\'s army. People begin to believe that Cole and his soldiers are the best weapons in Aegon\'s arsenal. He partially proves himself again at Rook\'s Rest, where his ambush scheme kills one of the Blacks\' finest dragons and her rider. Of course, his scheme backfired because he couldn\'t predict the unhinged actions of his king, who almost died in the attack.\n\nIs Criston Cole\'s role different in the books?\n\nCole\'s story in House of the Dragon is similar to his in Fire & Blood, but the details change at every turn to make the character a worse person. Cole served as Rhaenyra\'s defender until a botched romance drove them apart, but it never got as far as it did in the show. Rhaenyra tried to seduce Cole, then he slipped into her chambers to profess his love, but she refused to run away with him. Cole still killed Joffrey Lonmouth in the books, but he did so in a tournament rather than out of rage. Alicent supported him against the accusations of foul play, leading him to support the Greens. The show\'s biggest invention in Cole\'s life is his romance with Alicent, which never comes up in the books. Cole still becomes Aegon\'s Hand and orders Arryk Cargyll to attempt an unsuccessful assassination. He still fights across the Riverlands and Rook\'s Rest. Because the book lacks the hidden romance element, all of Cole\'s actions seem more sensible. His failures are genuine mistakes, rather than absurd overreactions to avoid getting caught. The HBO version of the character seems to value his sex life more than his actual life. He\'s a much more impressive figure in the books.\n\nWhat will happen to Criston Cole?\n\nA lot of people are asking whether Criston Cole will die. More accurately, in the context of House of the Dragon, they\'re asking when he\'ll die. It\'s Google\'s first autofill result most of the time. Cole marginally wins the battle of Rook\'s Rest. Aegon suffers wounds that lay him out for a year, and his dragon is left grounded, but at least Rhaenys is off the board. Cole remains the Hand of the King under Aemond, who temporarily sits upon the Iron Throne. Cole\'s plan is to take Harrenhal, which is currently under Daemon Targaryen\'s protection. He\'ll strike after he gathers enough strength from the Riverlands. The attack will appear to go perfectly. He\'ll walk right into the castle and easily claim it. Unfortunately for him, he will stumble into a trap. Daemon\'s army will abandon Harrenhal, using the lack of defense to take King\'s Landing. Cole will march to meet a Hightower army, hoping to take back the Red Keep. It won\'t work out, as the Blacks plant countless ambushes and destroy villages to deny them supplies. Finally, the remaining dregs of Cole\'s army will meet a force of 1,000 Black-aligned soldiers. He\'ll likely offer his life in exchange for the lives of his men, but his captors won\'t agree to his terms. Cole faces execution by arrows. Fans may get to see his head on a pike at the First Battle of Tumbleton.\n\nCriston Cole is probably the character who gets the worst treatment in House of the Dragon\'s transition to the screen. He\'s one of the most hateable characters in the show so far. There\'s still time to redeem him, but the quicker route might involve simply following him to his end in the books. If nothing else, Cole\'s days are numbered. Fans will have to wait and see how big that number might be. The Kingmaker has a path in place to meet his maker.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat Is The Tea In House of the Dragon?\n\nHouse of the Dragon Season 1 features a special tea, but what exactly does it do?', 'source': {'uri': 'gamerant.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Game Rant'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'joshua_kristian_mccoy@gamerant.com', 'name': 'Joshua Kristian McCoy', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ser-criston-cole-house-of-the-dragon-cropped.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9728405', 'sentiment': -0.1607843137254902, 'wgt': 458489765, 'relevance': 5}

Founded in 1916, it's the world's oldest continental soccer competition, bringing together national teams from South and North America.\n\nMillions of fans are waiting eagerly to watch the tournament live, especially the final, which could see Messi returning to the top of his game after a thigh/groin injury. Here are the top streaming services where the Copa America final (and other fixtures) will air in 2024:\n\nTo help you decide where to watch the Copa America final, we tested the best streaming services where the match is airing. Here are the highlights from our review:\n\nWatch the 2024 Copa America Final on TV Azteca\n\nTV Azteca Sports is Mexico's premier online destination for all things soccer, and luckily, they'll be showing the final for free. You'll need a Mexico location to access the service or use a VPN if you're abroad or traveling.\n\nThe website is simple and well-designed; you'll have no trouble navigating the match schedules, live video, replays, commentary pieces, and podcasts. You could also download the TV Azteca Deportes app on your Android and iOS phone or tablet.\n\nBear in mind that all text content (including navigation and match titles) is in Spanish, which we were able to instantly translate on Google. Further, since Azteca lets viewers watch the Copa America tournament for free, it is supported by ads.\n\nWatch the 2024 Copa America Final on FuboTV\n\nFuboTV is the official partner of many international sporting events, including the Euro 2024 tournament and Copa America. It streams content from popular TV channels like Fox Sports, ESPN, NBA TV, and many more, making it a good investment for sports fans.\n\nThe website is clean and compact despite FuboTV's massive content library. You can quickly tune into the live match without fumbling around with navigation; the snappy and responsive interface also helps. In addition to the website, you can install FuboTV on your phone, tablet, or smart television.\n\nFuboTV also lets you record up to 500 hours of content, which is useful if you can't catch the Copa America final live. For example, the match airs at 5:30 am in India; viewers could use a VPN to subscribe to FuboTV and record the match to view later.\n\nWatch the 2024 Copa America Final on YouTube TV\n\nYouTube TV gives you access to 100+ channels, including Fox Sports 1, where you can watch the Copa America final game. Its 5.1 surround sound capabilities make it ideal for watching live sports, and it provides unlimited recordings if you want to relive the top moments later.\n\nYouTube TV follows the same design principles as YouTube's primary video-sharing platform, which makes it easy to get started. When you're watching the match, the app's interactive filters allow you to keep up with live scores, commentary, and stats.\n\nThe app supports six devices and three simultaneous streams in one account, allowing you to watch the match even if a family member is watching something else. Furthermore, YouTube TV works on nearly every imaginable environment - from smart TVs to TiVo and even PlayStation - so you can catch the final from any device.\n\nUruguay overcame the might of Brazil in the Quarter-Finals and will be buoyed by such an impressive performance. However, Lionel Messi's Argentina will also be dreaming of another title, and the current World Cup holders are the favorites on paper.\n\nThe other sides, Columbia and Jesse Marsch's Canada will also have their sights set on the cup, and neither of them should be ruled out. Columbia won the title back in 2001 but overpowered Panama 5-0 in the last round, so they come into this in excellent form.\n\nHow to Watch Copa America 2024 Finals Anywhere\n\nThis year, the Copa America is being aired in only 33 countries worldwide. As a result, TV networks in many regions haven't managed to procure deals to broadcast the Copa America final. For example, the match won't be airing in India or South Africa due to the absence of these deals.\n\nTo watch the finals from any location, you can use a virtual private network (VPN), which will route your internet traffic through servers in your selected location. The streaming app will treat your request as if it originated from the remote server, unlocking the content.\n\nHere is the full list of countries (in alphabetical order) where the Copa America final will officially air. If you're watching the match from anywhere else, you'll need to use a VPN:\n\nEven if the Copa America final is airing in your country, a VPN allows you to switch to a region where it'll be streaming for free or at a lower cost. This can save you the expense of subscribing to an expensive new app only to watch one game.\n\nBest VPNs to Watch 2024 Copa America Final From Anywhere\n\nThere are several VPN solutions to choose from in 2024, but not all of them are trustworthy; some are not suitable for live-streaming sports. That's why we've tested the best VPN solutions to provide you with a comparative analysis ahead of the Copa America final so you can make an informed decision.\n\nPick a VPN with a zero-log policy to keep your private data and internet records safe. Ensure that the VPN provider has servers in one of the 33 countries where the Copa America final will air. Ideally, you should be able to install the VPN on smart TVs for a big-screen viewing experience.\n\nThe final is scheduled for July 14 in Miami, Florida and we'll be watching with bated breath. If the match isn't available in your region, use a reliable VPN to switch to a different server location where you can livestream the Copa America 2024 final on your preferred app.", 'source': {'uri': 'techreport.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Tech Report'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://techreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copa-America-Final-2024-1200x680.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9720117', 'sentiment': 0.1843137254901961, 'wgt': 458488056, 'relevance': 56}

He is a member of the Catawba Valley Youth Soccer Association boys 13-and-under team that qualified for U.S. Youth Soccer Association Nationals in June.\n\n"I like analyzing how the players play so I can have that memory in my head so I can do it in a game," he said.\n\nHis favorite Hickory FC player is Roger Sanguinetti.\n\nJason Koon is the Sports Editor for the Hickory Record and can be reached at jason.koon@lee.net.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'statesville.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Statesville.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/statesville.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/c1/bc1c24cc-3f92-5358-bd00-a2ebc4312cd4/669110880a84d.preview.jpg?crop=1533%2C805%2C0%2C46&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.1058823529411764, 'wgt': 458486132, 'relevance': 26}

He noted that steroid use in the NBA wasn\'t prevalent during his tenure in the league, and claimed that most players would fail drug tests in the NBA due to their use of marijuana.\n\n"Steroids? No... When I got my first chance in the NBA, it was one drug test. Then my second year, the CBA came in, and then it became four. So then my whole career I went through, it was four drug tests a year... Random, which is stupid. NBA owes Michael Beasley some money, they ruined his career with that sh*t."\n\n"Absolutely. 95% of the NBA. I will say 80% of players failed a drug test before for sure. Bud, marijuana. Steroids? Umm, nah. When I was in the NBA, so I was in the room. It\'s another curtain that you got to get behind. They ain\'t let me behind that other curtain. I don\'t know."\n\nTill 1:27\n\nTelfair played in the NBA from 2004 to 2014. If what he said is true, the 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the NBA and the NBPA would have enforced four random drug tests during the season for players, which would have gotten them caught for using any illegal substances.\n\nIf what Telfair says is true, it isn\'t hard to believe that many NBA players use marijuana as a recreational substance. However, because the legality of the drug has been very subjective for years, the NBA has listed it as an illegal substance in their CBA.\n\nIt was only last year, when the NBA signed a new CBA with the NBPA that marijuana was no longer classified as an illegal substance for drug testing. So now, players in the NBA can no longer be penalized for using marijuana recreationally.\n\nMany NBA Players Have Been Seen Smoking Weed\n\nTop NBA players like Kevin Durant have spoken openly and candidly about their marijuana use in the past.\n\nIn an interview in 2022, Durant even explained why he uses marijuana, citing the medicinal and mental benefits that the substance has brought to his life. Durant is also a known investor in several cannabis-related products and companies.\n\nDurant and other players have been spotted smoking weed on numerous occasions. Last year, KD was seen lighting up at a Drake concert. In a similar vein, Kawhi Leonard was seen a few weeks ago sparking up a blunt at Kendrick Lamar\'s show in Los Angeles.\n\nThe move to allow players to use marijuana is a good one, as players now have a little more freedom off the court in what they choose to do. And given both the medicinal benefits of marijuana, along with its lack of addictive quality, make it a better alternative for players to use compared to alcohol and other, more potent drugs.\n\nBut it should be remembered that marijuana is a substance, much like many others, that must be consumed in moderation. Players shouldn\'t be reckless enough to come to play under the influence, as it can be very damaging to the league. And NBA players will surely know the consequences of doing so and hopefully be careful.\n\nRelated: NBA Fans React After League Finally Lifts Ban On Marijuana Use For Players: "Been Lifted Since The Bubble..."\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

You\'ve made it painfully clear your true feelings with your relative silence on these Sox. Pass the passion onto those who care. It\'s time to cash out.\n\nSigned,A Red Sox Fan\n\nPS: Before you do, please don\'t let this season slip by ALL of us. It has been too good to be true, a credit to the people you have hired, and these are the days that become the stories to tell another baseball generation. You know, your future customers at the ol\' ball yard?\n\nMore: At midseason, the Boston Red Sox are offering something different this year -- hope\n\nMore: Will these Red Sox ever come close to the magic of the 2004 team? Hard to imagine\n\nPPS: We all need stories to tell -- that includes you, too -- to remind us of how good we\'ve had it, and how good it can be to have it again. Just don\'t forget that as you count the assets in your portfolio.\n\nHenry\'s baseball team is in a surprising and unexpected position to win now -- and what he does over the next few days and weeks should determine whether he deserves our trust, our faith and our hard-earned disposable income.\n\nThe Red Sox at the All-Star break have been a revelation in expectation. We (well, at least most of us) didn\'t expect anything close to how they\'ve performed. Were they undervalued? Have they overachieved? Likely, yes and yes.But can they sustain competitive relevance this season without an assist or a push toward the postseason in the form of an extra bat or another arm? Unlikely.\n\nThis season was already considered a "building" year by management. Suddenly, the build has become a boon. The team has the best record in baseball over the past month. Playing to an audience that is primed for immediate results based on recent history, these Sox must buy -- and not sell or trade off assets -- before the deadline and show us winning still matters.\n\nOr they\'ll slip further behind a championship basketball team, a contending hockey team and a football team still at the top of the popularity charts despite a fall from king-of-the-hill status. That likely won\'t do wonders for any professional portfolio.\n\nImprovements to the ol\' ball yard can\'t help regain the trust of a true Boston fan. Deep down, even pink hats should know there\'s nothing sweet going on here, Caroline -- this is put-up-or-shut-up time. Or it\'s time to put up the for-sale sign.\n\nThe last five Red Sox teams to win at least 50 of their first 90 games all made the postseason. The current team won exactly 50 of its first 90 games this season.\n\nI don\'t know about you, but for some added infield depth, maybe a right-handed bat off the bench, the Sox could do worse than swing a deal with Toronto for old friend Justin Turner.\n\n∎X post of the Week, from @LouMerloni: "Dave Dombrowski who \'guts everyone\'s farm system,\' \'can\'t build through the draft,\' \'leaves organizations in ruins,\' drafted Houck, Crawford and Duran. Signed Rafaella and Bello. Held onto Devers. Like I\'ve always said, every year you can sign/draft new prospects, improve MLB team."\n\n∎Jarren Duran has returned from baseball oblivion, unable to even accurately track down a routine flyball when he first arrived at Fenway. Now? After beginning his three previous years in AAA ball, this year Duran hit .365 in June, leads the majors in triples, runs faster than a whirling dervish on the bases and made the A.L. All-Star team.\n\n∎Whirling dervish? Go Google that one.\n\n∎While Rafael Devers won\'t play in the All-Star Game next week so he can heal up (that\'s a good thing), the Yankees should be sad he won\'t be swinging a bat in Arlington. Devers now has more go-ahead home runs against New York in NYC than ANY other player in Red Sox history -- including guys named Williams, Ortiz, Rice, Yaz and some old guy with a girl\'s name -- Ruth.\n\nNot for nothin\', but Devers is also the only player in Sox history to have three multi-homer games against the Yankees at age 27 or younger. The only other players to do this in the past 50 years? Ken Griffey Jr., Evan Longoria and Manny Machado.\n\n∎Stats that Amaze, courtesy of @SoxNotes: Tanner Houck is one of three Sox starters to strike out 100-plus batters and allow five or fewer homers before the All-Star break (with Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens); Kutter Crawford has the lowest opponent batting average against the Yankees (.176) of any Red Sox pitcher (minimum five starts).\n\n∎And, Ceddanne Rafaela is the first Sox rookie with at least 50 RBI and 10 stolen bases before the All-Star break.\n\n∎Alex Cora became the fourth-winningest manager in Red Sox franchise history this week. He could certainly qualify as the most valuable employee in that dugout. But in the last year of his Boston contract, are the Yankees just waiting to pluck him away?\n\n∎And if the next week or two don\'t go right, would he want to stick around, anyway? Just sayin\'.\n\n∎If you take the time to watch this year\'s version of the midsummer classic next week, take notice of several new MLB All-Stars playing in the game. Some names you might not know much about. I tend to think that\'s a good thing for a sport that needs a makeover (pitch clocks, hello!).\n\n∎Like Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes, who is the first MLB player to go No. 1 in the draft and become an All-Star the next year (after just two months from his call-up). But Skenes likely isn\'t the "sickest" one in a relationship with his girlfriend -- LSU national champ gymnast and Instagram/TikTok star Olivia Dunne.\n\n∎"Sickest," meaning cool, ICYMI. Dunne has a social media following of more than 13 million and is very much a leading figure in the collegiate Name, Image and Likeness derby. Paul who?\n\n∎Sox closer Kenley Jansen is also an All-Star. Duh. On the road this season, Jansen has thrown 16.1 innings and allowed no runs, with 18 strikeouts and an opponent batting average of .140.\n\n∎My buddy, "Big E," says he tells people to "have the day you deserve," rather than "have a nice day." He figures he\'ll let karma sort things out.\n\n∎The NBA announced its new TV deal with NBC, Amazon and ESPN this week -- 11 years, $76 billion. Qualifies as a wow in this book. TNT, however, reportedly has matching rights and is expected to go after Amazon\'s slice of the pie. The pay raise for the league (and the players, who receive 51% of basketball-related revenue) is nearly $5 billion annually.\n\n∎Does this also mean that Fox/Big East college basketball has to give back John Tesh\'s "Roundball Rock" theme music to NBC?\n\n∎Amica has most definitely AMP\'d up its marketing strategies. Two years after officially renaming the downtown Providence arena that serves as home court for the Friars, the insurance company this week became the new jersey patch sponsor for the Celtics.\n\n∎Does this also mean a championship is on its way down I-95?\n\n∎And best guess here -- logo patches are likely coming for college teams savvy enough to cut those deals -- the University of Hawaii has stepped up by placing them on practice jerseys, like you see in the NFL.\n\n∎Danny Hurley\'s new deal at UConn was made official this week -- six years, $50 million. This is after a six-year, $32-million extension was signed. But then the Lakers came calling and he turned down six years, $70 million from them.\n\n∎Wouldn\'t you like to be able to say "no thanks" to $70 mil? His average annual salary value is now second only to Kansas\' Bill Self ($8.33 million). His base salary is only $400K. That\'s a ton of high-priced speaking engagements, am I right?\n\n∎But it\'s also short of what Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont promised when he said, "We\'ll make sure that he\'s the top paid college coach" last month. Got some room to grow, Governor.\n\n∎Brown at Kansas on Dec. 22 and at Kentucky on New Years\' Eve? Whoa.\n\n∎If you\'re wondering why no Devin Carter for the Sacramento Kings in summer ball -- Carter is having surgery on his left shoulder that is likely to keep him off the floor until the start of the NBA regular season. No long-term issues are expected.\n\n∎The Final Four for 2026 in Indianapolis will include the Division II and III championships, plus the NIT semis and finals together for the first time. Sounds like a great party. We need an invite.\n\n∎Want a real no-brainer? Yes, the Patriots should re-sign Matt Judon to a new deal. They\'ve already set a precedent of re-signing several key veteran players. What does this make Judon if they don\'t sign him to a new contract? Veterans report to camp July 23. Judon is under contract for 2024.\n\n∎Familiar names in the news: You remember Bernie Kosar? The former Miami Hurricane quarterback starred for Cleveland (and Bill Belichick) but won his only ring with Dallas. He is currently battling cirrhosis of the liver and Parkinson\'s disease. Kosar is 60 years old and is on the list for a transplant.\n\n∎Speaking of Belichick, he\'s joining "Inside the NFL" (on the CW) as an analyst this season.\n\n∎Keegan Bradley, born in Vermont, raised in New Hampshire and in Hopkinton, Massachusetts (he also attended St. John\'s University), is the new Ryder Cup golf captain for the USA. He\'s also a good friend of Michael Jordan -- will the "GOAT" have any influence here?\n\n∎The Celtics\' Derrick White was an addition to the USA Olympic basketball team this week, replacing Kawhi Leonard on the roster. Leonard battled injuries last season and apparently didn\'t like French pastry enough to play. At least the Americans will have someone on the team who doesn\'t mind defending.\n\n∎White, Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday on the Olympic roster -- but not the NBA Finals MVP from the current world champs, Jaylen Brown. Shoulder, meet chip. Again.\n\n∎And happy 44th birthday to the biggest bug in Rhode Island, Nibbles Woodaway. You know, the Big Blue Bug on the I-95 Thurbers Avenue curve? Yeah, that one.', 'source': {'uri': 'eu.providencejournal.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Associated Press'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'john_rooke@eu.providencejournal.com', 'name': 'John Rooke', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3214dbf7bc779d4bab73af63e6725243862aa820/c=0-284-2567-1728/local/-/media/2020/10/01/Providence/ghows_gallery_ei-PJ-201009962-da39ab2a.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200', 'eventUri': 'eng-9722894', 'sentiment': 0.4039215686274509, 'wgt': 458484046, 'relevance': 32}

Both incurred points deductions.\n\nBut Everton have managed to hold on to Premier League status against the odds and the potential for a better financial future goes hand in hand with the move to the new 52,888-seater stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in time for the start of the 2025/26 season.\n\nThe new ground brings the potential for greater commercial revenue opportunities - and that is something that the club has already identified.\n\nBefore the Russian invasion of Ukraine back in early 2022, the Blues had in place a deal with former commercial partners USM that would afford the Russian firm first refusal on stadium naming rights. But with the sanctions imposed due to the Ukraine invasion, that deal will never come to fruition and the Blues have been in the market for the last two years for a new partner.\n\nBack in 2022, Everton engaged US firm Elevate Ventures to work alongside the commercial team at the club to try and find a partner for the stadium. Elevate had delivered on finding sponsorship for stadiums in San Jose, for the Earthquakes MLS team, and for the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team.\n\nThere are differences between the UK and US stadium naming rights market, with the value of such marketing inventory far higher in the US due to greater visibility of brands through lack of competition, while big businesses that reside within the states of the team whose stadiums they sponsor has largely been the trend.\n\nIn Spain, Barcelona were willing to risk wrath when they sold the naming rights for the Nou Camp to streaming giant Spotify. That deal could have been worth more had it not been for the fact that Barcelona had limited data on their fans, something that Spotify put a great deal of focus on and that damaged the overall value.\n\nThere is no doubt that Everton could command a sizeable sum on a multi-year deal from a potential naming rights partner given their status and at a time when the sport is increasingly globalised and reach extends into territories such as the US, which now have a huge interest in the game of \'soccer\', with the Premier League\'s US TV deal making up 20% of all global broadcast revenue for the most recent cycle.\n\nTottenham Hotspur\'s 2019 move to a new purpose-built stadium on the site of their old White Hart Lane ground saw them take residence on one of European football\'s most state-of-the-art venues. With a build that cost some £1.2bn plus, with £800m worth of debt still existing on the balance sheet as a result, Spurs looked into stadium naming rights early. Links with potential partners such as Google were mentioned but given chairman Daniel Levy\'s notoriety for getting a good deal, Tottenham are understood to be holding firm on what they believe the value of such a sponsorship space should be.\n\nLevy has also previously talked about the potential value of not handing over stadium naming rights to a firm, instead keeping the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium name, something that could be impactful in growing markets, especially given that the stadium hosts NFL regular season games annually.\n\nBut the US market is not the UK market and the same kind of success can\'t be assumed.\n\nIn 2019, financial firm SoFi acquired the naming rights to the home stadium of the Los Angeles Rams as well as the Los Angeles Chargers in a mammoth $600m-plus, 20-year deal. In 2021, Crypto.com paid $700m to take over the naming rights of what was once known as the Staples Center, the home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings. In 2024 the Los Angeles Clippers will open a new purpose-built arena in Inglewood, the rights for which have already been sold to Intuit for $500m.\n\nLos Angeles sits in California, a state with a bigger GDP than France, India, Italy and Brazil. It is home to some of the biggest firms in the world, firms that generate billions upon billions of dollars in revenue each year.\n\nThere is a trend in the US for major local firms to be the ones to take up the stadium rights. In the absence of front-of-shirt sponsorship opportunities across major North American leagues, although small jersey sponsorship patches are now permitted, and with the in-stadium branding fairly clean in US sport, stadium naming rights have a significant pull.\n\nSpeaking to the Bottom Line earlier this year, Daniel Haddad, head of commercial strategy at global sports agency Octagon, explained: "It\'s a completely different mark in the US, and I think one of the big mistakes that a lot of European clubs or sports entities make is actually trying to draw a comparison on the value of a stadium naming rights deal in the US and trying to translate it into what that could mean in Europe.\n\n"Essentially, the key difference is that if you look at traditionally how sports teams are able to sell their assets in the US, they don\'t have to share, they don\'t have the kind of other highly visible points of entry. The market in the US is almost kind of trying to accommodate those with jersey patches, etc. But it\'s always been in the US that stadium naming rights is the top-tier asset in terms of brand recognition and exposure.\n\n"There isn\'t the same extent of field signage in the US. If you watch an NFL game it is pretty much a clean environment from a stadium branding perspective. Obviously the model there is different and you get a lot of a lot more brands integrated in the broadcast spotlight as in sponsored segments on CBS or ESPN, but the actual playing environment is a lot cleaner.\n\n"Crypto.com is actually one of the exceptions to this, but mostly stadium naming rights are purchased by a massive business located in that state. So, if you look at most of the stadium naming rights deals in the US, the corporation would usually be a US company with its headquarters in that state.\n\n"The economies of these states can be massive. California is bigger than the UK economy, and in every state you have multiple businesses. The signature is billion-dollar revenue businesses that can afford that as a marketing expenditure. So, that\'s why it\'s a different market.\n\n"The other thing to consider is that it\'s always hard to sell a stadium naming rights deal outside of the US when it\'s not a multi-purpose, 365-day-a-year venue.\n\n"If you look at in the UK, for instance, even like the Co-Op Arena in Manchester, that was sold before it was constructed because that isn\'t a football stadium with a limited number of home games where the brand is present and then competitions like the Champions League on the calendar, where there is limited reference to the stadium naming partner and branding is taken over by UEFA sponsors."\n\nA number of clubs have sold stadium naming rights, with Arsenal\'s move away from Highbury seeing them enter into a long agreement with Emirates, while Manchester City has the Etihad Stadium, Brentford has the Gtech Community Stadium, and Brighton & Hove Albion has the AMEX Stadium.\n\nAll were new builds, unbound from the traditions that stopped the selling of rights previously, while three of those four clubs have alignment across major shirt sponsorship and stadium sponsorship, with Arsenal, Man City and Brighton\'s front-of-shirt sponsors the same as the stadium naming partner, limiting the dilution of rights and brand visibility.\n\nHaddad said: "For sponsors, you\'ve got the 19 matches in the Premier League and then a domestic cup. There are no rights around the Champions League or Europa League.\n\n"Let\'s say, for example, that a club hosts games in the Euros or World Cup, the commercial rights don\'t don\'t apply. So actually, the frequency of exposure for brands in these areas is a bit more diluted than you might initially think.\n\n"It\'s why something more ubiquitous like a shirt deal is always there as commercial partners now how much value and exposure they are getting."\n\nEverton are selling the naming rights for a stadium that won\'t just be used for 19 league matches and the odd cup match. The plan is for it to be a 365-day-a-year venue that caters for more than just football fans. That could be valuable, and in engaging with an agency to sell those bespoke rights, Haddad believes that the club has made a smart decision.\n\n"That is a very that is a very specialist area, and that\'s the kind of classic sponsorship sales agencies that clubs might use," said Haddad. "For instance, SportFive advises several clubs, Two Circles has a relationship with Arsenal, and CAA is working with Chelsea. It\'s not an alien concept for football clubs.\n\n"It\'s normal for clubs of a certain size to have sponsorship sales agencies, and actually within that those firms I\'m talking about are not specialists in stadium naming rights or stadium deals, they tend to focus very much on traditional assets or just traditional partnerships.\n\n"In the US there are businesses that are very specialised in the area of stadium naming rights. and and I say it goes, yes, stadium naming rights. They will have more knowledge institutionally of how to package a stadium naming rights partner because it\'s a completely different asset mix.\n\n"They have a lot more best practices in actually how to create a rights package that is best in class and fit for purpose. Firms like Elevate will have a lot more institutional knowledge within the US.\n\n"When Shahid Khan (Fulham owner) was looking at buying Wembley Stadium, one of the reasons he wanted to buy it was because he thought it was massively under-commercialised based on his experience of operating a stadium in Jacksonville with the Jaguars.\n\n"They had all sorts of crazy stuff in the Jacksonville Stadium, and they had something like 25 brand partners.\n\n"Shahid Khan was basically saying, why in the UK is a stadium completely under-commercialised, not even just from a naming rights partner perspective, but other ways of integrating? I think if you were looking for an external resource to help you monetise a stadium, you probably wouldn\'t go to one of the big European agencies or more established football agencies.

While hosting the 2024 ESPY Awards, Serena Williams brought up Bronny James\' recent entry into the NBA. She wished Bronny success in his career and made a joke about LeBron James\' hairline receding.\n\n"A big moment in sports this year was LeBron James\' son, Bronny... He got drafted to the Lakers where he will play with his dad. And I truly hope Bronny has a long career... So long that he will see his hairline recede, then, miraculously un-recede, like dad."\n\nIt was clearly a cheeky dig from Serena Williams, who poked fun at LeBron\'s hairline, something that fans, analysts, and even other NBA players have been doing for years. It\'s unlikely James would mind at all, or take any offense to Williams\' comments.\n\nHowever, later in the night, Serena would take a more pointed shot at the The King. While talking with her daughter on stage, Williams pointed out that James wants to win a championship with the Lakers this year with Bronny James on the team.\n\nShe then remarked that she was able to win a grand slam while being pregnant, and claimed her accomplishment was more impressive.\n\n"The women\'s game is extremely physical... LeBron wants to win with his son on his team, I won with my daughter in my belly. I think we know which one is way more impressive."\n\nOnce again, LeBron is unlikely to take offense to this jab from Serena. And while LeBron winning a championship with Bronny James would be an incredible accomplishment, it is hard to rival the incredible achievement of Serena Williams.\n\nJames has often shown Serena Williams a lot of love and respect. Much like James, Williams is considered one of the all-time greats in her sport. And James even suggested that she was the GOAT during her incredible performance at the 2022 U.S. Open.\n\nLeBron James Faces Criticism For Bronny James Getting Drafted\n\nFormer NBA player Steven Hunter recently slammed LeBron James for using his power and cachet within the Lakers organization to get his son Bronny drafted. He claimed that LeBron and Rich Paul abused their power to get Bronny James a guaranteed contract, something second-round picks don\'t usually get offered.\n\n"For those that don\'t know... Late second-round picks don\'t get guarantees (Especially before summer league). Typically late second-round picks don\'t get 4 year guaranteed roster spot deals either. This wasn\'t earned I\'m sorry... And it\'s an egregious abuse of power from LBJ & Rich Paul."\n\n"It\'s a slap in the face to all of the kids out there who work their asses off to get to the league. It\'s sneaky Hollywood s**t like this that turns a lot of people off about LeBron... This is just another example of what they be talking about right when you try to like\'em."\n\nWhile there is some criticism that can be made about Bronny\'s path to the NBA, LeBron James hasn\'t done anything morally wrong. Any father would want his child to have opportunities and will use their power to give them those opportunities. James wanted the best for his son and did what he felt was right to get him what he needed.\n\nFurthermore, several players in the NBA have benefitted from some form of nepotism. While Bronny\'s case might be the most high-profile, and the most extensive, he is not the only second or third-generation player to get a chance in the NBA thanks to their parent.\n\nBronny James will be eager to prove the critics wrong next season. While his opportunities with the Lakers will be limited, as he will spend most of his time in the G-League, he will want to show that he deserves the contract he was given by the 17-time NBA champions.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

After a dismal debate performance, Biden has been fending off calls to step aside as the party\'s presumptive nominee. His much-anticipated news conference came on the last day of the NATO summit. Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Senate Democrat to call for Biden to step aside.

Neither is quite sure what to do.\n\nTrump lawyers press judge to overturn hush money conviction after Supreme Court immunity ruling\n\nDonald Trump\'s lawyers are urging the judge in his New York hush money case to overturn his conviction and dismiss the case in the wake of the Supreme Court\'s recent ruling on presidential immunity. The former president\'s lawyers wrote in papers made public Thursday that prosecutors rushed to try Trump in April and May while the high court was still considering his immunity claims. Trump was originally scheduled to be sentenced Thursday, but that\'s on hold until the trial judge, Juan M. Merchan, rules on whether to set aside Trump\'s felony conviction for falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal. Merchan has said he\'ll rule on the defense\'s requests on Sept. 6.

Then he added, in a stage whisper, "No poll\'s saying that."\n\nHe argued he\'s delivered results over rhetoric\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden tried to make the case that what he\'s doing matters more than how he talks about it.\n\nHe praised the just finished NATO summit as elevating America\'s standing. "Have you ever seen a more successful conference?" Biden said to a group of reporters who often only got to see the conference during prepared remarks.\n\nHe drilled down on how inflation eased from its 2022 peak as he reeled off statistics such as the creation of 800,000 manufacturing jobs under his watch, saying world leaders would want to trade their own economies for what United States has.\n\nHe also said he would cap how much rent could grow for tenants of landlords who are part of a tax-credit program for low-income housing.\n\nIt\'s the same pitch Biden made in stump speeches without necessarily doing much to move his own popularity. His team believes it will sink in if repeated constantly.\n\nHe brought up his work on NATO\n\nBiden kicked off the press conference by talking at length about NATO and its value to the United States -- one of his strongest political issues against Trump, who has been openly skeptical of the alliance and once suggested he\'d encourage Russia to attack NATO members whom he considered delinquent.\n\nBiden tied himself to an American tradition stretching "from Truman to Reagan to me" of defending NATO. "Every American must ask herself or himself, is the world safer with NATO?" he asked.\n\nLater, to assure a European journalist asking about governments on that continent worrying Trump could win, Biden launched into a detailed recounting of how he helped shepherd Finland into the alliance.\n\nAfter that, he went into detail about how to push back against China for supporting Russia during its war against Ukraine and contended he will continue to be able to deal with Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nOverall, Biden spoke forcefully and fluently about foreign policy, one of his favorite subjects. But the news conference\'s focus wasn\'t really foreign policy, it was reassuring Democrats and the world that Biden is still able to be president and beat Trump.\n\nThat shows how even Biden\'s strengths are being overshadowed by questions about his capabilities.\n\nWhen possible, he went back to the stump speech\n\nEvery politician has a stock set of lines. And whenever Biden could, he went back to his favorite talking points. It was a way to answer the question without necessarily needing to say anything spontaneous or new.\n\nHe went after trickle-down economics, borrowing a line about his father never benefiting much from tax cuts aimed at the wealthy ("I don\'t remember much trickling down to his kitchen table"). He hailed Delaware for leading the country in corporations. He said he\'s the "most pro-union labor president in history." He explained his decision to run for a second term with a variation on his "finish the job" catchphrase. He went into his standard spiel about computer chips.\n\nWith no time limit on his answers like he faced at the debate, Biden went on for several minutes at a time telling stories about his interactions with foreign leaders and making the case for his reelection.\n\nHe answered questions in detail -- unlike at the debate\n\nThere were few fireworks in Biden\'s answers -- with the highly anticipated event at times coming across as more of a think tank lecture than an effort to grab voters\' attention. He went into granular detail on geopolitics and rattled off numbers -- asking at one moment, though, to not be held to the precise figure.\n\nWhile it didn\'t erase the stumbles and blank stares from the debate, it showed that he could engage with reporters\' questions on a range of issues without losing focus.\n\nThere was still regular coughing and throat clearing. And at times he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper that evoked the rasp of his voice on debate night.\n\nOverall, his presentation was a reminder that people are focused on him now with an almost clinical eye toward possible slip-ups and mistakes, the kind of pressure that is unlikely to go away for as long as Biden insists he\'ll stay in the race.\n\nMore coverage:\n\nThe Latest: Biden news conference is key event as he faces calls to step aside\n\nPresident Joe Biden has held a news conference in what is considered a key event in a monumental week for his campaign.

The former president\'s lawyers wrote in papers made public Thursday that prosecutors rushed to try Trump in April and May while the high court was still considering his immunity claims. Trump was originally scheduled to be sentenced Thursday, but that\'s on hold until the trial judge, Juan M.

Unlike its rivals -- GM\'s Cruise, Amazon\'s Zoox, or Tesla\'s still-vaporware "Cybercab" -- Waymo provides driverless service to the paying public in Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nSo when a recent trip to Southern California for the VidCon Anaheim conference left me with a spare day and a half to tool around L.A., there was no question about how I\'d roll in that city. Or at least in Waymo\'s service area, which arcs from downtown to just south of Santa Monica but sadly excludes Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nWith a Waymo-provided code to skip a waitlist in the city -- a speed bump the company has removed in Phoenix and San Francisco -- I took four rides:\n\nAll of those rates landed within a dollar or so of what I later saw Uber and Lyft estimate pre-tip for the same routes. With no human drivers to motivate, Waymo has no surge pricing, but I did see its estimates fluctuate slightly over several minutes.\n\nHailing a Robotic Ride\n\nThe Waymo One app for Android and iOS offers a ride-booking flow like that in Uber and Lyft: Set your pickup point and destination, wait for the service to estimate your price and wait for a car, then confirm the trip if the cost and time work for you.\n\nThe app then shows an estimate of your car\'s arrival and maps its location, including stoplights in its path. Waymo cars -- white Jaguar I-Pace battery-electric hatchbacks festooned with LiDAR and other sensors -- look alike, but you shouldn\'t need to check the license plates on an arriving vehicle because it also displays your initials in a roof-mounted beacon.\n\nWhen the car stops, tap a button in the app to unlock the car via Bluetooth. There\'s plenty of room for three full-sized humans between the front passenger seat and the rear seats; the middle of the back seat can work for shorter rides or smaller humans. The trunk easily accommodated three pieces of rolling luggage.\n\nThe car won\'t move until you tap a "Start Ride" button on the dashboard touch screen, so there\'s no scramble to buckle seat belts. On my first ride, that display played an intro to Waymo that advised that its cars include inward-facing cameras as a safety measure and to "improve our product," plus a microphone that only activates if you call support.\n\nWaymo\'s touch screen lets you choose from a menu of iHeartRadio stations, with the default a chill "Ambient Vibes" instrumental soundtrack. You can also play from apps on your phone, but not via Bluetooth audio. Instead, you need to grant the Waymo app access to your Google account so you can use the "Cast" button in compatible apps.\n\n(If you use Google\'s YouTube Music app on Android, you\'ll need to pay for a subscription to the service of the same name to use that output option. Which is dumb.)\n\nLet\'s Roll\n\nOn all four rides, I found Waymo to be a cautious and courteous driver, sometimes distractingly so. The car used its turn signals every time and stopped for every pedestrian and cyclist in a crosswalk -- even when a bus blocked much of the view -- but I also saw it brake before cars that had only inched out of driveways or garages.\n\nLeft turns at stop lights had cars inching forward and then braking and then inching forward, once only proceeding a second before a yellow light turned red.\n\nThis politeness sometimes wasted time, such as when one car did not pull around a vehicle waiting to turn left at a light to use the lane open to its right. I also found myself wishing that this car would have honked at the pickup truck in the lane to the right that edged toward us until a few inches separated our side-view mirrors.\n\nWaymo programs its cars to obey all speed limits -- a restriction that some Waymo passengers mope about, but one that I appreciated on surface streets shared with cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nWaymo\'s grasp of pedestrian infrastructure, however, may need an upgrade. My ride to Union Station ended badly when the robotaxi drove up to a sidewalk in front of that beautiful work of Mission Revival architecture, did not continue past the construction fencing blocking part of the sidewalk, and instead turned left to unload me on a landscaped median.\n\nHuman Factors\n\nPeople haven\'t always taken well to robotaxis -- a crowd set a Waymo on fire in San Francisco\'s Chinatown in February -- but the reactions I got around L.A. left me feeling more like a rock star. Pedestrians stopped and stared, while other drivers smiled or gave thumbs-up approvals.\n\nI didn\'t expect to get that sort of entertainment value out of a robotaxi ride.\n\n(See also: when I spotted a Serve Robotics delivery bot rolling along on the sidewalk and had to wonder if the smaller autonomous vehicle noticed the larger one and thought "friend?")\n\nAs for other Waymo passengers, all four cars looked fresh-off-the-lot clean inside. A day later, I learned that Waymo checks for lost belongings when I got a "Did you lose something today?" email. It explained that the service sends a note to the last four people to have taken rides in a car when it finds a left-behind item.\n\nAlthough there\'s no tipping, the app asks you to review each ride on a one-to-five-star scale. I handed out five-star reviews for my first three rides, which led to the app inviting me to select among aspects that made the ride great, such as "Smooth drive" or "Wait time."\n\nI was not so happy about the last ride and its improper drop-off. But with no human driver\'s feelings or livelihood at stake, I felt liberated to whack Waymo with a three-star rating.\n\nNot Enough Cars\n\nMy worst experience came before I buckled up for that fourth ride. First, my wait for a car at Pershing Square dragged on for longer than the predicted four minutes. But because the app did not show the car\'s location while it had another passenger onboard, I didn\'t know what was happening. Then the ride\'s status changed from "arriving" to "Trip canceled," leaving me thinking: Wow, just like Uber and Lyft!\n\nDetermined to finish this experiment, I summoned another car and had the longest wait of all four rides; an estimated 20 minutes turned into 25. The delay left me appreciating how the app offers precise walking directions to a pickup spot and thinking that a normal human going to Union Station would have jumped on the subway, a $1.75 fare.\n\nAn automated email from Waymo apologized for my trip cancellation and blamed it on "operational reasons on our end."\n\nAfter I shared my ride information with spokeswoman Katherine Barna, she said in an email that this looked like a case of the system automatically canceling a trip after it got delayed past what it had calculated was "a reasonable amount of time."\n\nShe added that the system should have sent another car automatically, but none were close enough, a complaint now popping up on Reddit\'s r/waymo forum.\n\nThe Roads Ahead\n\nReactions from people about self-driving cars, however, are often less "will I have to wait too long" or "will it make me step through shrubbery?" and more "will the robotaxi accelerate into a bridge abutment?"\n\nThat is not so much Waymo\'s doing, although its cars have committed driving flubs like last week\'s case of a Waymo driving into an oncoming lane in Phoenix after being confused by construction signage-as the fault of an entire industry that has spent years overpromising and underdelivering.\n\nAnd in the case of Uber\'s since-shelved self-driving effort, Cruise\'s robotaxis, and Tesla\'s misleadingly-named "Full Self-Driving," the consequences have included serious injuries and even deaths.\n\nBut you should not overlook how bad human drivers can be. Beyond grim statistics that include 42,514 deaths on American roads in 2022, I\'m also thinking of the two human-driven rides that preceded my introduction to Waymo. First an early-morning run to Washington Dulles International Airport had a Lyft driver disregarding speed limits and safe following-distance principles, then a taxi from LAX to Venice saw our driver apparently allergic to his vehicle\'s turn-signal stalk.\n\nSo would I summon a Waymo for my next ride if transit would not serve me effectively? Yes. But I can\'t until I return to its three active cities. And even there, Waymo\'s service boundaries can hold it back -- especially in L.A., where LAX is sorely absent from its service area.\n\nBarna said "we\'ve been in contact with LAX and it\'s an area we look forward to serving in the future," adding that Waymo has been doing overnight curbside pickups and drop-offs at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport since last year.\n\nFreeways also remain off limits to Waymo passengers, although the company began testing highway driving in January in Phoenix with safety drivers up front. Waymo\'s mandatory speed-limit compliance may make its vehicles a more awkward fit with human-driven cars there.\n\nDon\'t expect rapid advancements. Waymo has been insistent that it\'s not a "move fast and break things" company and will stick with a methodical, iterative approach to testing and deploying robotaxis.\n\nAs a business, Waymo itself is still finding its bearings. In Alphabet\'s most recent quarter, the "Other bets" category of ventures led by Waymo yielded a $1.02 billion loss, while Bank of America reportedly put Waymo\'s 2024 losses at $1.2 to $1.5 billion.\n\nBut Waymo not only has the advantage of technology in use by paying customers and Uber\'s endorsement, it has its corporate parent\'s nearly boundless pockets. So there\'s a lot of on-ramp here, even if that may also mean a long wait for your own Waymo ride.', 'source': {'uri': 'pcmag.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PC Magazine'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'rob_pegoraro@pcmag.com', 'name': 'Rob Pegoraro', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/07HPYqfGS4SzCZVxZINO4z9-5.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1720736243.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9715839', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 458481928, 'relevance': 83}

You\'re going to beat President Putin."\n\nBut he was defiant when a reporter brought up his reference to "Vice President Trump" and noted the presumptive Republican nominee\'s campaign was already promoting the slip-up. "Listen to him," he said, before walking off the stage.\n\nOne House Democrat, Rep.

While hosting the 2024 ESPY Awards, Serena Williams brought up Bronny James\' recent entry into the NBA. She wished Bronny success in his career and made a joke about LeBron James\' hairline receding.\n\n"A big moment in sports this year was LeBron James\' son, Bronny... He got drafted to the Lakers where he will play with his dad. And I truly hope Bronny has a long career... So long that he will see his hairline recede, then, miraculously un-recede, like dad."\n\nIt was clearly a cheeky dig from Serena Williams, who poked fun at LeBron\'s hairline, something that fans, analysts, and even other NBA players have been doing for years. It\'s unlikely James would mind at all, or take any offense to Williams\' comments.\n\nHowever, later in the night, Serena would take a more pointed shot at the The King. While talking with her daughter on stage, Williams pointed out that James wants to win a championship with the Lakers this year with Bronny James on the team.\n\nShe then remarked that she was able to win a grand slam while being pregnant, and claimed her accomplishment was more impressive.\n\n"The women\'s game is extremely physical... LeBron wants to win with his son on his team, I won with my daughter in my belly. I think we know which one is way more impressive."\n\nOnce again, LeBron is unlikely to take offense to this jab from Serena. And while LeBron winning a championship with Bronny James would be an incredible accomplishment, it is hard to rival the incredible achievement of Serena Williams.\n\nJames has often shown Serena Williams a lot of love and respect. Much like James, Williams is considered one of the all-time greats in her sport. And James even suggested that she was the GOAT during her incredible performance at the 2022 U.S. Open.\n\nLeBron James Faces Criticism For Bronny James Getting Drafted\n\nFormer NBA player Steven Hunter recently slammed LeBron James for using his power and cachet within the Lakers organization to get his son Bronny drafted. He claimed that LeBron and Rich Paul abused their power to get Bronny James a guaranteed contract, something second-round picks don\'t usually get offered.\n\n"For those that don\'t know... Late second-round picks don\'t get guarantees (Especially before summer league). Typically late second-round picks don\'t get 4 year guaranteed roster spot deals either. This wasn\'t earned I\'m sorry... And it\'s an egregious abuse of power from LBJ & Rich Paul."\n\n"It\'s a slap in the face to all of the kids out there who work their asses off to get to the league. It\'s sneaky Hollywood s**t like this that turns a lot of people off about LeBron... This is just another example of what they be talking about right when you try to like\'em."\n\nWhile there is some criticism that can be made about Bronny\'s path to the NBA, LeBron James hasn\'t done anything morally wrong. Any father would want his child to have opportunities and will use their power to give them those opportunities. James wanted the best for his son and did what he felt was right to get him what he needed.\n\nFurthermore, several players in the NBA have benefitted from some form of nepotism. While Bronny\'s case might be the most high-profile, and the most extensive, he is not the only second or third-generation player to get a chance in the NBA thanks to their parent.\n\nBronny James will be eager to prove the critics wrong next season. While his opportunities with the Lakers will be limited, as he will spend most of his time in the G-League, he will want to show that he deserves the contract he was given by the 17-time NBA champions.\n\nRelated: 8 No. 1 Overall Picks Sons Have Played In The NBA\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

He forcefully declared he would stay in the race and would win.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Joe Biden faced a test Thursday that he had avoided so far this year: a solo news conference with questions from the White House press corps.\n\nThe news conference was meant to reassure a disheartened group of Democratic lawmakers, allies and persuadable voters in this year\'s election that Biden still has the strength and stamina to be president.\n\nBiden has tried to defend his feeble and tongue-tied performance in the June 27 debate against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump as an outlier rather than evidence that at age 81, he lacks the vigor and commanding presence that the public expects from the commander in chief.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nGolden Corral in Merrillville reopens after closing in 2020 after then-franchisee\'s cold case arrest for Missouri murder Judge rejects plea in domestic shooting; man threatens to throw chair at judge 18-year-old dies in car crash on Fourth of July in Portage, police said NWI Business Ins and Outs: Taco Pros, Brass Idol, Red Zone Sports Bar, Windy City Pizza Kitchen, Sweet Circle, Starbucks, Alexander McQueen and Caribbean Roots opening; Evvy\'s Coffee and Deep Blue Seafood closing Cedar Lake man found dead while sitting in a pond, police say Dispensaries stacking up on Michigan border despite weed remaining illegal in Indiana New store opens at Southlake Mall Church\'s much-anticipated Harvest Square Strip Mall to have ribbon-cutting, bring \'services of suburbs\' to Gary Indiana Toll Road increases tolls Twisted Sugar opens in Schererville Friday Inmate death at Porter County Jail ruled a suicide, officials say Hobart roundabout moving to phase two Latest alleged prison smuggling attempt involves cocaine, marijuana and lasagna Mother charged with neglect after 18-month-old overdoses 62-year-old man dies Monday morning after his vehicle strikes tree, police say\n\nHe made at least two notable flubs, referring at an event beforehand to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as "President Putin" and then calling Kamala Harris "Vice President Trump" when a reporter asked about her.\n\nBut he also gave detailed responses about his work to preserve NATO and his plans for a second term.\n\nHe also insisted he\'s not leaving the race even as a growing number of Democratic lawmakers ask him to step aside.\n\nHere are some highlights from the news conference:\n\nHe bungled key names -- and remained defiant\n\nPerhaps Biden\'s biggest slip-up in the news conference came early on when he referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as "Vice President Trump," in saying he picked her because he believed she could beat Trump.\n\nEven before the news conference, Biden bungled an important name at the NATO summit and instantly lowered expectations for his performance.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Biden said as he was introducing Ukrainian President President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is most definitely not Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe gaffe immediately prompted gasps, as Biden caught himself and said to Zelenskyy: "President Putin? You\'re going to beat President Putin."\n\nBut he was defiant when a reporter brought up his reference to "Vice President Trump" and noted the presumptive Republican nominee\'s campaign was already promoting the slip-up. "Listen to him," he said, before walking off the stage.\n\nOne House Democrat, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, issued a statement minutes later calling on the president to withdraw.\n\nHe insisted, \'I\'ve got to finish this job\'\n\nIt\'s a delicate dance between the president and vice president, with many Democrats openly pining for Harris to replace Biden on the ticket. Biden didn\'t acknowledge that tension, but only brought Harris up in response to pointed questions about whether he believed she had the capability to replace him.\n\n"I wouldn\'t have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president," Biden said, citing Harris\' resume from prosecutor to the U.S. Senate.\n\nBut in response to a later question he acknowledged he\'d moved on from his 2020 campaign promise to be a "bridge" to a new generation of Democrats. "What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited," he said, without a word about his vice president.\n\nRepeatedly, he said, "I\'ve got to finish this job."\n\nThe news conference ended with Biden being asked directly whether he\'d step down for Harris if he saw polling showing she had a better chance of beating Trump.\n\n"No, unless they come back and said there\'s no way you can win," Biden responded. Then he added, in a stage whisper, "No poll\'s saying that."\n\nHe argued he\'s delivered results over rhetoric\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden tried to make the case that what he\'s doing matters more than how he talks about it.\n\nHe praised the just finished NATO summit as elevating America\'s standing. "Have you ever seen a more successful conference?" Biden said to a group of reporters who often only got to see the conference during prepared remarks.\n\nHe drilled down on how inflation eased from its 2022 peak as he reeled off statistics such as the creation of 800,000 manufacturing jobs under his watch, saying world leaders would want to trade their own economies for what United States has.\n\nHe also said he would cap how much rent could grow for tenants of landlords who are part of a tax-credit program for low-income housing.\n\nIt\'s the same pitch Biden made in stump speeches without necessarily doing much to move his own popularity. His team believes it will sink in if repeated constantly.\n\nHe brought up his work on NATO\n\nBiden kicked off the press conference by talking at length about NATO and its value to the United States -- one of his strongest political issues against Trump, who has been openly skeptical of the alliance and once suggested he\'d encourage Russia to attack NATO members whom he considered delinquent.\n\nBiden tied himself to an American tradition stretching "from Truman to Reagan to me" of defending NATO. "Every American must ask herself or himself, is the world safer with NATO?" he asked.\n\nLater, to assure a European journalist asking about governments on that continent worrying Trump could win, Biden launched into a detailed recounting of how he helped shepherd Finland into the alliance.\n\nAfter that, he went into detail about how to push back against China for supporting Russia during its war against Ukraine and contended he will continue to be able to deal with Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nOverall, Biden spoke forcefully and fluently about foreign policy, one of his favorite subjects. But the news conference\'s focus wasn\'t really foreign policy, it was reassuring Democrats and the world that Biden is still able to be president and beat Trump.\n\nThat shows how even Biden\'s strengths are being overshadowed by questions about his capabilities.\n\nWhen possible, he went back to the stump speech\n\nEvery politician has a stock set of lines. And whenever Biden could, he went back to his favorite talking points. It was a way to answer the question without necessarily needing to say anything spontaneous or new.\n\nHe went after trickle-down economics, borrowing a line about his father never benefiting much from tax cuts aimed at the wealthy ("I don\'t remember much trickling down to his kitchen table"). He hailed Delaware for leading the country in corporations. He said he\'s the "most pro-union labor president in history." He explained his decision to run for a second term with a variation on his "finish the job" catchphrase. He went into his standard spiel about computer chips.\n\nWith no time limit on his answers like he faced at the debate, Biden went on for several minutes at a time telling stories about his interactions with foreign leaders and making the case for his reelection.\n\nHe answered questions in detail -- unlike at the debate\n\nThere were few fireworks in Biden\'s answers -- with the highly anticipated event at times coming across as more of a think tank lecture than an effort to grab voters\' attention. He went into granular detail on geopolitics and rattled off numbers -- asking at one moment, though, to not be held to the precise figure.\n\nWhile it didn\'t erase the stumbles and blank stares from the debate, it showed that he could engage with reporters\' questions on a range of issues without losing focus.\n\nThere was still regular coughing and throat clearing. And at times he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper that evoked the rasp of his voice on debate night.\n\nOverall, his presentation was a reminder that people are focused on him now with an almost clinical eye toward possible slip-ups and mistakes, the kind of pressure that is unlikely to go away for as long as Biden insists he\'ll stay in the race.\n\nMore coverage:\n\nThe Latest: Biden news conference is key event as he faces calls to step aside\n\nPresident Joe Biden has held a news conference in what is considered a key event in a monumental week for his campaign. After a dismal debate performance, Biden has been fending off calls to step aside as the party\'s presumptive nominee. His much-anticipated news conference came on the last day of the NATO summit. Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Senate Democrat to call for Biden to step aside. Over a dozen House representatives have publicly called for Biden to end his campaign.\n\nObama and Pelosi huddled as Democrats look to steer Biden out of 2024 race\n\n(CNN) -- Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi have spoken privately about Joe Biden and the future of his 2024 campaign. Both the former president and ex-speaker expressed concerns about how much harder they think it\'s become for the president to beat Donald Trump. Neither is quite sure what to do.\n\nTrump lawyers press judge to overturn hush money conviction after Supreme Court immunity ruling\n\nDonald Trump\'s lawyers are urging the judge in his New York hush money case to overturn his conviction and dismiss the case in the wake of the Supreme Court\'s recent ruling on presidential immunity. The former president\'s lawyers wrote in papers made public Thursday that prosecutors rushed to try Trump in April and May while the high court was still considering his immunity claims. Trump was originally scheduled to be sentenced Thursday, but that\'s on hold until the trial judge, Juan M. Merchan, rules on whether to set aside Trump\'s felony conviction for falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal. Merchan has said he\'ll rule on the defense\'s requests on Sept. 6. Prosecutors have until July 24 to respond.\n\nPresidential debate: Biden, Trump square off in Atlanta, in photos\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.', 'source': {'uri': 'nwitimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'nwi.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'assets@nwitimes.com', 'name': 'assets', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'tncms@nwitimes.com', 'name': 'tncms', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/35/435bd864-8225-5ea1-91bf-e21bba6a399e/6690911434f57.preview.jpg?crop=1741%2C914%2C8%2C42&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9720525', 'sentiment': 0.1372549019607843, 'wgt': 458480181, 'relevance': 29}

Both are diagonal crossings at street intersections with no stop signs.\n\nDOT project manager Kris Sommers said the two crossings "are on our hot list of crashes."\n\n"These crossings have been quite unsafe for a number of years," Sommers said.\n\nSince 1979, the two crossings have accounted for 11 train crashes, including three fatalities and two injuries. Six of the collisions involved pedestrians and one involved a bicycle.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Wisconsin\'s prisons hired them anyway.\n\nVehicle collisions not involving trains are far more common. From 2018-22, there were 17 collisions at Hagar/Avon and nine at St. Cloud/Liberty. Sommers said the diagonal rail crossing is a major factor.\n\n"It\'s not ideal to have that angle," Sommers said. "The angles compromise safety and vision."\n\nAnother problem is the amount of time trains block intersections, which the third track is designed to alleviate.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n"The trains sit there for so long," said Jennifer Harnisch. "It makes it hard for pedestrians to cross."\n\nShe and husband, Jeremy, live less a block from one of the intersections. She said trains can block traffic for up to 30 minutes at a time. The DOT estimates "crossing activations" block traffic an average of four hours per day.\n\nSommers said the DOT\'s preferred solution is to close the St. Cloud/Liberty intersection and install an 8-gate closure system at Avon/Hagar. He said the 8-gate system would make it more difficult for motorists to drive around the gates after they\'re activated.\n\nThe plan would also reconstruct sidewalks to create 90-degree pedestrian crossings and erect stop signs at the Avon/Hagar intersection.\n\nDOT began taking feedback last December. Sommers said there was opposition to closing either intersection. He said the public was also cool to an an option that would turn Avon and Liberty into one-way streets.\n\nJeremy Harnisch said closing any north-south roads would increase congestion on the North Side.\n\n"There are only four roads that get by the tracks," he said.\n\nThe third track will run from the Mississippi River to a rail yard east of George Street. DOT projects manager Aaron Bowe said the additional track will allow for more efficient boarding at the Amtrak station in La Crosse. He said there are no plans for additional rail capacity outside La Crosse.\n\nThe project is slated for 2026.\n\nThe public can submit comments through Aug. 10.

So many moving stories about games impacting readers\' lives! I\'ve since heard a great one that you might offer as an OI bonus. My friend Tom from Brookfield\'s sweet mom, Jane, went into labor midgame but didn\'t say a word. Pack wins, she tells hubby Hank, and they race to ER. Tom always assumed his birthdate was delayed into the next morning by an ordinary game, then he recently Googled it. Turns out his mom gritted through the 1962 NFL Championship win over the Giants.\n\nIsn\'t that something? Jane\'s a real trooper. Thanks to everyone who participated in this year\'s Outsider Inbox. The response is a testament to this football team and its devout fanbase. I\'ve personally grown to love this time of the year. Instead of talking about nothing for the sake of speaking, it\'s great to reflect and share some heartwarming stories about the gravity pulling us all together. I think we hit the sweet spot with 10 questions over five days, too. I can\'t wait for 2025.\n\nRoss from Hudson, WI\n\nGoing into last year\'s training camp it felt like there were a number of question marks, many of which became exclamation points by year end - Jordan Love, WRs, TEs, etc. This year, there seems to be a number of question marks, as well: Best five on OL, starting LBs, half of the starting DBs, new defensive coordinator/scheme, etc. The powers that be took a similar method of addressing the areas of weakness this year as last, so the question now is, which concerns will become strengths by year end this season?\n\nI\'m excited about the secondary and the safety position in particular. Xavier McKinney was an exclamation point the day he signed his contract, but overseeding the lawn on the backend was a pragmatic move on Brian Gutekunst\'s part. The addition of Javon Bullard, Evan Williams and Kitan Oladapo not only provides depth on defense but also special teams, where safeties can be extremely valuable. Anthony Johnson Jr. and Zayne Anderson aren\'t going anywhere, either. They\'re both hungry to compete. Overall, it\'s a fresh start for an essential position.\n\nKeith from Springfield, MO\n\nThanks for all your effort! What would you say are the primary professional and personal characteristics that make Matt LaFleur a winner and highly rated NFL head coach? The media\'s highest rating for ML so far has been seventh and I think he deserves to be rated much higher - even before he wins a SB with the Pack (just a matter of time). His teams have won so many games starting from his first year! I think now that ML has the ability to be very tough, yet not offend his players?\n\nHe\'s creative as hell and always willing to learn. To LaFleur\'s successes, I would also attribute his ability to strike a balance between staying true to himself and also evolving as a head coach and leader. I think LaFleur would tell you he\'s a much different man today than he was when the Packers hired him on Jan. 8, 2019.\n\nJeff from Indian Lake, NY\n\nSafe to assume Jordan Love\'s arrow is pointing straight up. In fact, it\'s so high up there I don\'t know if we can see it. I would imagine that\'s how a lot of Packers fans feel. But is that fair? He played absolutely lights out over the second half of last season. And he\'s so young and just starting to get real game experience the expectation must be MVP-level or bust. I just wonder how he\'ll respond to that added pressure and whether that pressure is justified. Progress isn\'t always linear.\n\nI don\'t disagree progress and production aren\'t easily predictable, but that\'s where the third \'P\' matters: the person. Of all the variables this upcoming season, the one of which I worry least is pressure affecting Jordan Love. Composure is his greatest gift. Love is still only 25. He\'s going to make mistakes, but it won\'t be because the lights are too bright for him.\n\nJason from Mt. Prospect, IL\n\nHaving Keisean Nixon in his prime, fully healthy, and very low workload as a returner to this point in his career makes me excited about this new kickoff platform. However, injuries happen. I\'m curious to see whom our returner would be if Nixon were to need time off. Bo Melton did a lot of returning in his college days, although I think mostly on punt returns. Jayden Reed is too valuable as a receiver to toss out there. I\'m not sure Samori Toure makes the 53...Whom do the Packers have in mind?\n\nIt\'s a worthwhile question given the Packers have the option to put two returners back in the landing zone. Reed is listed as the backup to Nixon but seems more like an emergency option at this point. Toure will be in the conversation. Dimitri Stanley was catching balls in OTAs, as well. MarShawn Lloyd is another name to follow. It was mentioned after the draft the rookie third-round pick could be a return candidate, too.\n\nDave from Gwinn, WI\n\nI know this has no merit in your eyes, but Kenny Clark wasn\'t even in ESPN\'s list of top 5 DTs. Is Justin Madubuike seriously better than Kenny? I swear there\'s a "South Park" joke in here somewhere...\n\nI\'m not going to compare one defensive tackle to another, but if you can\'t appreciate what Kenny Clark has done here the past eight years, then you\'re clearly haven\'t watched the Packers. Clark has been the guy on that defensive line for six years while playing a ton of snaps in a read-and-react front. In my opinion, he\'s the most underrated defensive tackle in the NFL. I\'ll stand on that. Maybe it\'s because Kenny is a quieter dude who doesn\'t toot his own horn, but I\'ve never understood how Clark gets continually overlooked in All-Pro voting and other league polls.\n\nTK from Grafton, WI\n\nWhen I started my Packers fandom in the 1970s, the draft was 12 rounds long. In 1994, it was shortened to seven rounds. Is the current value of a seventh-round pick equal to what a 12th-rounder used to be? Is "last round" now worth what a "last round" used to be?\n\nI don\'t think so because organizations invest so much more money and resources into preparing for an NFL Draft than they did in 1970. It\'s still a crapshoot to a certain extent but teams pretty much know everything there is to know about college players these days. Because every pick is valuable. Just look at how much hay the Packers made the past two years with the seventh-round selections of Rasheed Walker and Carrington Valentine, both solid pros at premium positions.\n\nDarrel from Pueblo, CO\n\nII, if someone is picked off a practice squad; do they have to accept, or could they refuse because they think their options are better with the current practice squad/team?\n\nFirst, there\'s no "picking off" because every practice-squad player is a free agent. They\'re signed to two-way contracts that can be terminated by the player or team at any time. The player is free to sign to another team\'s 53-man roster each week, which is how the Packers acquired Bo Melton, Allen Lazard and Rasul Douglas. It\'s common once an interested team moves to sign a player off another team\'s practice squad for that player to go to his current team to see if it wants to sign him to its 53-man roster or increase his practice-squad pay (which counts towards the salary cap).\n\nLori from Broomfield, CO\n\nHow much influence on team character revolves around the direction from offensive and defensive captains?\n\nA lot of it. LaFleur often talks about the best teams being player-led. That doesn\'t necessarily mean which player gives the best pregame pep talk. Julius Peppers barely spoke during his three years here, but he had an aura around him that his teammates rallied around. Marcedes Lewis had a similar impact from 2018-22.\n\nPaul from Northglenn, CO\n\nCan there be any greater solace in 13 world championships than having Reggie and Charles get their lone rings as Green Bay Packers?\n\nIt\'s a pretty sweet achievement. I wish Julius and Cedes could\'ve joined them.\n\nKelly from Stoughton, WI\n\nIn response to Jeff from Brooklyn, Spoff said something along the lines of it\'s on the personnel department to know if a prospect is developing as they should. Can you expand on that? Do we have scouts that just watch our practices and young players to see how development is coming? I would think the coaches can handle that but maybe they are too invested in installs and who is making the correct play? How does that shake out? Loved to hear from Vic, eagle on a par-4.\n\nIf it\'s filmed, someone is watching. Obviously, coaches grade players in the classroom but Brian Gutekunst and his top lieutenants also attend practices to watch players and get feedback. Away from the field, Gutekunst and Matt LaFleur also meet frequently to discuss the state of the roster.\n\nJosh from Playa Majagual, Nicaragua\n\nI think we may be a little naïve in stating coaches in the NFL aren\'t teaching their players how to bend the rules. Offensive linemen are taught how to get away with a hold by keeping their hands inside the frame of the body, DBs are coached on when and how they can get away with a late grab to close the gap, and WRs are instructed how to draw PIs on uncatchable balls. Most coaches are former players, and they all learn and teach how to gain an edge without getting flagged. No longevity!? See: Bill Belichick.\n\nWhat I took from Spoff\'s response was you can\'t teach bad technique. That\'s how bad habits develop. There\'s a difference between understanding where the lines are blurred (e.g. an O-lineman keeping his hands inside the framework of the body) and where contact could get you in trouble as a DB. Even if it\'s not called in a game, teams review tape every week. If you\'re putting bad film out there, the opposition will work to expose it.\n\nJustin from Harrisburg, PA\n\nI did not check the second round, but the last time all first-round QBs were re-signed by the teams that drafted them was in 2008. The Falcons drafted Matt Ryan No. 3, and the Ravens drafted Joe Flacco No. 18.\n\nIt\'s rare for a draft to produce first-rounders who all become franchise quarterbacks for the team that selected them, especially in this day and age when six QBs come off the board in the first 12 picks.\n\nDaniel from Chillicothe, MO\n\nCould a visiting team ever "buy" a win on the road? What I mean is if the visiting team\'s fanbase could acquire enough tickets via home-team resale on the secondary market, would it make a difference in the outcome of the game. I\'ve been thinking about this ever since we hosted Detroit last year and they had way too many fans in attendance.\n\nI\'ve never attended a more Packers-friendly road game than Green Bay and the Los Angeles Chargers in 2019. There might have been 500 Chargers fans at 27,000-seat Dignity Health Sports Park and Philip Rivers didn\'t care one bit during a 26-11 drubbing of Green Bay, which was 7-1 heading in.\n\nWoody from Kill Devil Hills, NC\n\nPickled asparagus! That actually makes sense. I often put pickled cabbage on my brats (aka sauerkraut). It is time to try the asparagus. I\'ll have to try it with spareribs too. Thanks Wes.\n\nNinety percentage of the brat-constructing process is pickling the asparagus. The other half is mental.\n\nGreg from Perkasie, PA\n\nThere was a moment in the first episode of the offseason edition of "Hard Knocks" with the Giants where there was some tension between the GM and owner when discussing Saquon Barkley\'s future with the team. Do you think the Packers lack of a traditional owner creates any sort of advantage in regard to situations like that?

And those of you who are not can draw lessons about free enterprise competition from this dispute.\n\nBoth artists have been sparring verbally by releasing lyrics and making other slights. The latest strike involved Lamar\'s West Coast Juneteenth concert, where he garnered the apparent support of a number of legendary West Coast rappers such as Dr. Dre and Ty Dolla $ign, as well as the endorsement of notable A-list NBA stars such as Lebron James and Russell Westbrook.\n\nSome in the media, such as ESPN\'s Stephen A. Smith, have called on the artists to cut it out. But this call for inaction not only demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the impact of competition on the history of free enterprise in America, it exposes a basic lack appreciation for what has always moved the culture of hip-hop forward: conflict.\n\nThat is to say, "beef" not "chicken" has been the fuel to this culture all along.\n\nThe history of competition in America is a story that traverses economic, social and political arenas. From as early as the Colonial era, there was competition among European powers and American Colonies. There was persistent conflict around price regulation. Later, the American republic ushered in free trade, creating markets in all sectors of the era, including agriculture, manufacturing and shipping.\n\nWhen we push forward in time, we get to the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, where the business of railroads, oil and steel gave birth to more competition -- so much that the monopolistic approach of industry barons like Rockefeller and Carnegie ultimately required government intervention to rein them in. Legislation such as the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890 and, in 1914, the Clayton Antitrust Act and creation of the Federal Trade Commission were intended to seed and spawn greater competition.\n\nIf we leap forward, we land on the late 20th and 21st century. Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a wave of deregulation aimed at increasing competition in industries such as airlines, telecommunications, and finance. This also brought on the advent of globalization.\n\nAmerican companies faced increased competition from international firms, leading to greater innovation and efficiency. Finally, the 21st century gave rise to the digital economy. Technological giants like Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google to this day engage in epic battles using marketing and innovation to attempt to assert market dominance. Just like the infusion of competition helped write and shape the origins of free enterprise in America, the presence of competition in rap and hip-hop helps define its market and its culture.\n\nThe history of competition among hip-hop artists in America is real. Competition is the very thing that has fueled its evolution over time. Let\'s go old school. The issue of the birthplace of hip-hop can be debated, but most credit the Bronx in the 1970s.\n\nDJs such as Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa showcased their skills. MCs (rappers) began to emerge, competing to entertain crowds with their lyrical prowess.\n\nLater, rap battles became a core element of hip-hop. These live, lyrical competitions between MCs were about showcasing lyrical creativity and stage presence. Notable early battles include those featuring Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee in 1981.\n\nThen came the era of "crews," teams of rappers or rap groups that formed like other groups around a common vision or idea about their music. Crews such as the Sugarhill Gang, Run-D.M.C. and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five led to crew rivalries and fierce competition that caused innovation and an overall elevation in the rap scene.\n\nThe golden age of hip-hop resulted in the 1980s and early 1990s. Less than a decade later, we saw a further crystallization of competition with such artists as Rakim, LL Cool J, Public Enemy and N.W.A.\n\nBut where the true Apple vs. Samsung, King Kong vs. Godzilla completion reached its pinnacle was in the rise of the East Coast (New York) vs. West Coast (California) rivalry. This epitomized the hip-hop of the 1990\'s.\n\nTupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls (aka The Notorious B.I.G.) became the culture ambassadors for their respective turfs, -- Shakur for the West Coast and Smalls for the East Coast. The rivalry was everything -- business and personal. Some would argue that it went too far, as both men unfortunately lost their lives.\n\nBut we can have healthy competition without violence. For example, just jump forward and look the high profile beef between Jay-Z vs. Nas. Their 2001 battle, highlighted by tracks like Nas\'s "Ether" and Jay-Z\'s "Takeover," is considered one of the greatest rap battles in history.\n\nIn the end, rap and hip-hop are marinated in the same American sauce that has made free enterprise and entrepreneurial ship the catalyst for success for so many before us. Competition can get too personal and go too far in any facet of life, but a healthy dose and the right concoction of it can serve as springboard for a country and a culture.\n\nLet these lions be lions! Let Drake and Lamar continue to do battle. Ultimately, the market will decide. They both will be richer because of it, the lovers of hip-hop will gain an incredible body of work and young up-and-coming artists will be lifted in their wake.\n\nAs The Notorious B.I.G. put, it, "If you don\'t know, now you know."', 'source': {'uri': 'thehill.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Hill'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'opinion_contributors@thehill.com', 'name': 'Opinion Contributors', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Kendrick-Lamar.jpg?strip=1&w=640', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 458478662, 'relevance': 31}

He missed Colonial Downs immensely during the 5-year gap.\n\n"That makes my summers, coming out here," he said. "All the friends you meet and connections you make. It\'s like seeing family, coming down here."\n\nA mainstay at the track, Shores fondly recalls memorable Virginia Derbies -- the license plate on his car is VADERBY -- and favorite jockeys and breeders over the years, such as Nellie Mae Cox, a legendary figure in the state\'s horse breeding history.\n\nCox, who died in 2015 at 75, was born in Richmond and lived at historic Rose Retreat Farm in Goochland for 50 years.\n\n"Every year, it\'s picking up and there\'s improvements, the fan experience is getting better," Shores said from the balcony overlooking the track, a short distance from where Cox used to sit.\n\n"It\'s going to be an exciting season."\n\nJockey Trevor McCarthy has made upward of 11,000 starts in a career that dates to 2011. He\'s been racing at Colonial Downs since 2019 and was the track\'s leading rider that year and in 2020.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nLast year, at the Virginia Derby, McCarthy won the Virginia Oaks and the Colonial Cup.\n\n"It\'s a great atmosphere to be here, a lot of fans come out," McCarthy said, standing in the middle of Colonial Downs\' paddock as stable hands walked horses around prior to the call to post.\n\n"It\'s great racing, great horsemen, great horses, great jockeys, great owners. Everything about it is awesome. It\'s always a pleasure to be here."\n\nAs Bonne Fille trotted to the winner\'s circle, awaiting her was a familiar face.\n\nKaren Godsey\'s mother was on the architectural review committee to build Colonial Downs. A trainer on her farm in Ashland, Godsey has been coming to the track since it opened.\n\nBut this opening day was a little extra special for her. One of Godsey\'s clients tasked her with saddle breaking two fillies this year, Bonne Fille and Bella Bluegrass.\n\nThat gray pair was born and raised together, inseparable until about two months ago, when Bonne Fille was sent off to trainer Michelle Lovell in Kentucky.\n\nOn Wednesday, the horses reunited.\n\n"It was just fireworks, they\'ve been so in love with each other and are so familiar with each other," Godsey said of the meeting.\n\nBonne Fille, the favorite at 3-5 odds, won a short sprint -- five furlongs on the outer turf -- via a hard chase through the far turn before she eased out four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up late under strong handling.\n\n"When she was that far back, seeing that stretch run it was \'Ooh, she\'s going to be second,\'" Godsey said of Bonne Fille\'s showing.\n\n"Then she just kept on coming and hammering down, it was a pretty exciting finish."\n\nAn exciting finish indeed, among the first of what\'s sure to be many this summer at Colonial Downs.\n\nLast year the track averaged $700,000 a day in wagers across the 27-day season. Many people bet remotely, through sites such as TwinSpires, which is owned by Churchill Downs.\n\nThe Colonial Downs: A $2 million day at the races\n\nKey dates this season include the Festival of Racing on Aug. 10; the Virginia Derby on Sept. 7; and, new this year, wiener dog races on Aug. 24, honoring former Colonial Downs director of facilities Bo Scott, who died last year and had long hoped for the track to host wiener dog races.\n\nAlso of note is the return of night racing to Colonial Downs. On Friday, the track will host its first races under the lights since 2019.\n\nZach Joachim (804) 649-6555\n\nzjoachim@timesdispatch.com\n\nZach Joachim\n\nDeputy Sports Editor\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Zach Joachim Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

"Two years ago we added the swim and paddle for the women, and last year we added the women\'s can run. The can run is a very unique event, one athlete simulating a rescue with a (surf) dash and a short swim.\n\n"This year we added the women\'s surf dash, and that was an easy add. Former Chief (Tony) Cavalier, one of his favorite events was always the surf dash. With the passing of Chief this past winter, it\'s a good time to add the event. When he retired the City created the Cavalier Cup for the winning team, and they can take it home for the year."\n\nPeople are also reading...

Spampinato then holed out in two putts to preserve his victory.\n\nVictor\'s Aiden Spampinato, who helped Methodist University win the Division III championship in May, held off a slew of contenders over the final 18 holes Thursday and won the 101st New York State Amateur Championship at Hamburg\'s Wanakah Country Club.\n\nSpampinato, 21, finished three rounds at 6-under-par 210 to win by a shot over 23-year-old Alex Zurat of Rochester\'s Oak Hill Country Club and Scarsdale\'s James Allen, who just finished his senior season at Penn State University.\n\n"This is amazing," said Spampinato. "So many thousands of hours of hard work have led up to this and I\'m very grateful."\n\nSpampinato, who plays out of suburban Rochester\'s Cobblestone Creek, made second-team Division III All-America for a second straight year this spring, and he was the No. 10-ranked Division III player in the nation. Methodist, in Fayetteville, N.C., is a golf powerhouse, with 14 D-III titles in the last 35 years.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nAt least four tornadoes, two packing 110 mph winds, hit Western New York, weather service reports Pregnant in her sophomore year, Bennett High School graduate finds self-worth - with plenty of help Man shot dead by Buffalo police is brother of slain 12-year-old Stop and look: How the new Bills stadium is already drawing in spectators Alan Pergament: \'Beatles\' host JP leaves WECK after disagreement with station owner Buddy Shula Bills quarterback Mitch Trubisky finds his way back home Sabres trade top prospect Matt Savoie to Oilers for Ryan McLeod, Tyler Tullio Do the Sabres need a goal-scorer after landing Ryan McLeod to center the third line?

"Luckily, I was able to keep it together just by going through my routine every single shot and being 100% committed to every single shot. That was a big goal for today."\n\nA tweak to his putting routine helped. Just before getting set to make each stroke on the green, Spampinato cocked his right shoulder backward twice.\n\n"About a week ago, I was working with Potters Putting," he said, referring to an online coaching program. "They wanted to see my shoulders get more level instead of the right one getting lower. The lower right shoulder was putting me out of whack, my path, and my putter face is a lot better with the shoulders level. I\'ve hit hundreds of putts in my basement this week just working on that, and it really paid off."\n\nThe 5-foot-7 Spampinato took the lead for good with three birdies in a four-hole stretch to move to 7 under after the seventh hole. He made an 8-foot putt on the par-3 fourth, and an 18-footer on the 201-yard seventh, after hitting a 5-iron.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nA bunch of challengers were within a shot or two the rest of the way but never caught him.\n\nThe top Buffalo-area finishers were 39-year-old Jamie Miller of East Aurora\'s Crag Burn Golf Club and 35-year-old Tonawandan Kris Boyes. They tied for eighth at even par. Miller, a private wealth adviser at UBS Financial Services, is president of the New York State Golf Association. It was a particularly good finish for him, considering he has three children under 22 months old at home.\n\nAllen, the 2021 state amateur champion, got to 7 under after 14 holes and was just a shot behind. But he bogeyed the tough, 210-yard 15th, then bogeyed the par-4 16th.\n\nZurat, who shot a course-record 63 at Oak Hill\'s famed East Course last month, got within a shot after making eagle on the par-5 14th. After a 300-yard drive, he hit a 3-wood from 235.\n\n"It ended up way right, almost on the tee box on 15," Zurat said. "From 35 yards, I can really throw it up in the air. It went pretty high, landed once and rolled in. It was a perfect shot."\n\nBut Zurat mis-hit a delicate chip on 16 to make bogey, then hit an errant drive right on 17 for another bogey.\n\nZurat graduated from Florida Atlantic but didn\'t play golf there, instead opting to play as an amateur in Florida pro mini-tour events.\n\n"I\'m trying to get used to professional golf, where you\'ve got to go low," he said. "You\'ve got to shoot 7 under."\n\nIt was a long day at Wanakah, with 68 golfers playing 36 holes, including a two-hour weather delay. Spampinato\'s final putt went down as the sun was setting at 9 p.m.\n\nThe Wanakah course, which is celebrating its 125th anniversary, withstood 1.5 inches of rain Wednesday, yet the greens still were about 12 on the Stimpmeter on Thursday. Wanakah hosted the state amateur on its 100th anniversary in 1999, but the course is even better than it was then, because there are more close-shaved runoffs around the greens, and a lot of tree removal has opened up views of Lake Erie.\n\n"I was super-proud of having it here," Miller said. "It\'s a 10 out of 10.

I have no interest in predicting it again, and there\'s no data to say that it\'s going to happen, so we should just move on.""\n\n-- Steve Eisman, managing director at Neuberger Berman\n\n\'Big Short\' investor Steve Eisman has said "there\'s no fundamental case to be massively short" in the current stock market and said it would be "insanity" to start shorting stocks like Nvidia.\n\nEisman, who was played by Steve Carrell in the 2015 film \'The Big Short,\' said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that he believes "the economy is fine" and that there\'s "no case to be massively short" on it.\n\n"The economy is fine," Eisman said. "Is it slowing a little bit, sure. Are delinquencies up in consumers, OK. But there\'s no fundamental case to be massively short things."\n\nThe hedge fund manager, who was profiled in Michael Lewis\' book on the 2008 financial crash, also said investors who are shorting technology giants like Nvidia have a "death wish" as he predicted the emergence of artificial intelligence will boost the world\'s biggest tech companies.\n\n"Shorting a stock purely because you think it\'s expensive is a death wish," Eisman said. "You have to have a fundamental reason to be short a stock."\n\n"Is Nvidia NVDA, -5.57% expensive, yeah it\'s expensive but earnings have tripled," Eisman said, as he argued the current winners from the AI rally are likely to be the winners of the future.\n\n"The obvious winners are Nvidia and what I\'d call \'arms dealers,\' and then you have Microsoft MSFT, -2.48%, Amazon AMZN, -2.37%, Meta META, -4.11%, Google GOOG, -2.78%, Oracle ORCL, +0.77%, people who have big cloud, big database businesses, and after that it\'s \'we\'ll see\'"\n\nEisman said he believes the emergence of AI technologies will drive the "biggest refresh cycle in history" as he argued customers will be forced to buy a whole set of new electronic devices in order to use the most cutting edge AI apps in a shift that could boost firms like Apple AAPL, -2.32%.\n\nEisman also said he believes there\'s "no data" showing we\'re nearing the "end of the world" as he brushed aside concerns about the the buildup of commercial real estate and the U.S. fiscal deficit.\n\nHe argued that the commercial real estate debt situaiton is "just not a systemic issue," while noting that only 40% of that debt is held by banks and that very little of that debt is held by the big banks, meaning only regional banks are likely to face any "significant risk".\n\nHe also downplayed fears around the accumulation of the U.S. national debt, as he noted that: "Every single word that people are uttering about the deficit today has been uttered for the past 40 years."\n\nEisman, who is a managing director at asset management firm Neuberger Berman, also said he has "100% certainty Donald Trump wins" the upcoming elections in November, as he argued pro-Palestine protests could sway the national vote.\n\n\'The protestors that have been on the college campuses are going to converge on Chicago on mass and what I\'m quite sure is going to happen is they\'ll burn Israeli flags, they\'ll torch the stars and stripes, they\'ll spew whatever they spew".\n\n"The whole country\'s going to be appalled and the election will be over, just like that," the outspoken investment manager said.', 'source': {'uri': 'marketwatch.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MarketWatch'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'louis_goss@marketwatch.com', 'name': 'Louis Goss', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://images.mktw.net/im-866296/social', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 458472813, 'relevance': 30}
